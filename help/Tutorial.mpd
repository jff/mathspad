improvement, since many more ``higher-level'' options are built in, but inevitably
one has to build up one's  own personal macro file before one can effectively and
comfortably use the  system. 

Experienced users of 8fPHN2A02 will already have several  individually customised
``stencils8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLHN@E4$8bMHN0E38bNHN0E28bOON0E1stencil'' at their
disposal.  These files contain specifications of commonly occurring  notational
elements in the user's documents, ranging from  section or chapter headings to the
preferred notation and layout for, for example, unbounded summations and
products.  Before beginning to write a new document the experienced user will
---ideally---  examine the manuscript carefully for new notational elements
and define these appropriately on the system.  Few of us, however, are sufficiently
well-disciplined to do this  in advance, and most will define new stencils on the fly
in the process of writing  one's document. The greater one's existing stock of
definitions the  less frequently this is necessary and the smaller the  delay it causes. 
The delay is thus the greatest for the
beginner and it is of course the beginner who is the least adept at defining stencils.

In order to ease this initial hurdle a number of stencils are provided with the
8fPHN2A02 distribution.

Since the creation of
stencils is the hardest part of using 8fPHN2A02 (although it isn't that difficult!) we
postpone its discussion to the very end of this tutorial.  You will, however, be using
various stencils almost from the very beginning even though at times you may not
be aware of it.

Before we can begin at all, it is important that we agree on terminology  for
referring to the  buttons8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLHN0E48bMHN0E38bNON0E2buttons8bOMN0E1mouse on the mouse.  We assume that your mouse has
three buttons.  If your mouse does not have three buttons you will  need to use
the rightmost button in combination with the control key to simulate the third
button. You are warned that this feature has never been thoroughly tested.

Modern computer systems allow you to customise the mouse (and just about
everything else) to your own preferences.  For right-handed people the leftmost
mouse button is often the one  that is easiest to use, for left-handed people (who
operate the mouse with their left  hand) it is more likely to be the rightmost button. 
Left-handed people may therefore wish to change the default settings on their
computer so  that any action initiated by default by the leftmost button is initiated
in their case by the rightmost button.   We won't tell you how ---it's often not very
easy to find out and  there is no standard (software) mechanism for doing it that
we  know of--- but we are acutely aware that  what is ergonomic for one person
is not ergonomic for the other.   

Ideally, in order to reflect this situation, we would now introduce some
(standard) terminology to refer to the three mouse buttons that emphasises
their logical functions rather than their relative physical positions. 
Unfortunately, a standard terminology hasn't yet emerged and until there is
we feel it would be too much of a burden  to ask you to commit three new terms
to memory.  What we  shall do is very much a compromise: we shall
refer to the buttons as the  8fPIN2A0@8bOLN0E1near8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLHN0E48bMLN0E3near8bNON0E2buttons8bOMN0E1mouse button, the 8fPIN2A0@8bONN0E1middle8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLHN0E48bMNN0E3middle8bNON0E2buttons8bOMN0E1mouse button, and the

right-handed people--- the leftmost button, and the far button will typically be
the rightmost button.  (We realise that this terminology may be confusing to
those who operate the mouse with their left hand but have not made
any changes to the default settings on their computer.)

move the menu to any position you want on the screen.  (If you don't have a

indication of whether the menu is pinned up or not.) 

It is suggested that you pin up three of the  menus at this stage: the menus under
the  8fPIN2A0C8bONN0E1EditOp, 8fPIN2A0C8bO1AN0E1Structure  and 8fPIN2A0C8bO1AN0E1Selection  buttons.    You won't need them all 
immediately but it may save you time later, and it will give you an idea of the
extent of the features offered by 8fPHN2A02.  Arrange them as neatly as you
can in a clear area of the screen.  

(You can get as many copies of the pin-up menus as you wish, and scatter them
all over the screen.  8fPHN2A02 is not stingy, and tidiness is your concern!  To

The main goal of 8fPHN2A02 is to enable algebraic calculations to be conducted on
a computer terminal.  The first thing you must learn in order to do this 
effectively is how to select subexpressions.  A simple mathematical 
expression has been displayed below in order to let you practise the technique.

respectively.  For the  moment it doesn't matter which of the three you use.  

The expression above has a certain structure that is governed by the normal
precedence conventions of arithmetic.  The structure is evident from the spacing
around the operators and the parentheses.  
   
Use the scroll bar to position the  expression at the very top of the screen so that you
can both read and carry out these  instructions at the same time.  (The mouse
pointer should be placed in the scroll bar  at the side of the window alongside the
expression.  Then click with the near button.)  Now position the mouse pointer to
point to one of the  operators and then click8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLHN@E4$8bMHN0E38bNHN0E28bOMN0E1click (i.e. press and release one  of the mouse 
buttons). Do this for each of the operators in turn.  Use the same mouse button
each time or else things may get confusing.  

In each case the subexpression you have selected will be highlighted (the colour of the
highlighting being dependent on the  mouse button you used).   If, for instance, you click
on the division operator you will select the  subexpression 8fPKN0A08fPKN1A08fPIN0A0e8ePHN2B0Y8fPIN0A0f8ePHN2B0[8fPIN0A0g.  What is selected in
this way is  the operator and its  arguments.  Thus, when you click on either of the two
``+''  operators you select only the two adjacent arguments:  clicking on the first  ``+''
selects 8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B0Z8fPIN0A0b and on the second 8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0b8ePHN2B0Z8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0c8ePHN2B0\8fPIN0A0d.  Similarly if you click on the  leftmost minus sign
you select 8fPKN0A08fPKN0A08fPIN0A0c8ePHN2B0\8fPIN0A0d8ePHN2B0Y8fPKN0A08fPKN1A08fPIN0A0e8ePHN2B0Y8fPIN0A0f8ePHN2B0[8fPIN0A0g.   If an operator has been  declared to be infix (for example ``+''
or ``8fPIN0A0-'') you can select the whole expression by a ``double click'' over the operator.    Try
this  with either of the two ``+''  signs  or the leftmost ``8fPIN0A0-'' sign.  (You must press and
release quite fast twice in  succession.)  

Just for the fun of it, try placing the mouse pointer anywhere in the text and 
clicking rapidly several times in succession.  If you position the pointer in the
middle of a word and click twice you will select the word.  If you click three
times you will select the line in which the word appears, and four times the
whole document.  You can undo your selection by clicking the same mouse
button over  a blank line in the text.

many  times you have clicked is the following.  Position the mouse pointer. Then
press a  button down but 8fPIN2A0I8bO1JN0E1do  not release it.  (That is, keep it held down.  Do not
allow it to  come up again.)  When you are ready, release the button and press it
in again 8fPIN2A0I8bO2FN0E1rapidly and without releasing.  Pause awhile (keeping the mouse
button firmly  in place) before repeating the release-and-press-down action.  If
done at the  correct speed you will see the selection widening step-by-step.   If
you do it too  slowly, however, you will go back to square one.  At first you will
probably  be  inclined to overdo the speed, or press-down-and-release quickly
rather than  release-and-press-down quickly,  but the technique is soon
mastered.

Let us go back to our arithmetic expression.  Since it will inevitably  have
disappeared from your screen by now we reproduce it below so that you can
both  read and practise simultaneously.  Position the text so that the expression
is near but not at the very top of the screen.  (Leave this sentence visible for
example.)

Try out your multiple click technique beginning with the mouse pointer

and then the whole expression.  It's worth continuing to see what  happens next! 
(Sometimes the selection doesn't seem to alter.  If that is the case keep on
clicking until the whole screen has been selected.)  For most purposes you will
only need the  single and double click but sometimes more can be useful.

 Clicking selects complete subtrees of an expression. Dragging the mouse 
pointer enables you to select certain incomplete subexpressions.  Position the 
mouse pointer this time over 8fPIN0A0b and press a button down again without releasing
it.  The symbol 8fPIN0A0b will be highlighted.  Now 8fPIN2A0I8bO2DN0E1without releasing the button move
the pointer across the screen.  Do this slowly (and for as long as you like) so that 
you can observe its effect.  You will find that you can select subexpressions like 
8fPJN0A08fPIN0A0b8ePHN2B0Z,  8fPLN0A08fPIN0A0b8ePHN2B0Z8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0c8ePHN2B0\8fPIN0A0d8ePHN2B0Y  and 8fPMN0A08fPIN0A0b8ePHN2B0Z8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0c8ePHN2B0\8fPIN0A0d8ePHN2B0Y8fPKN0A08fPKN1A08fPIN0A0e8ePHN2B0Y8fPIN0A0f8ePHN2B0[8fPIN0A0g. You can also select the subexpression 8fPKN0A08ePHN2B0Z8fPIN0A0b8ePHN2B0Z
by first positioning the mouse pointer at one of the ``8fPHN2A0Z'' signs and dragging 
across to the other. You cannot select 8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0b8ePHN2B0Z8fPIN0A0c   in this way because as soon as you 
move the pointer over the 8fPIN0A0c the selection jumps so as to include the whole 
subexpression 8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0c8ePHN2B0\8fPIN0A0d.  This reflects the way that the expression is stored in the 
system.  It is a tree structure consisting of a root and a 8fPIN2A0I8bOLN0E1list of subexpressions.
The subexpressions are in this case 8fPIN0A0a, 8fPHN2A0Z, 8fPIN0A0b, 8fPHN2A0Z, 8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0c8ePHN2B0\8fPIN0A0d, 8fPHN2A0Y, 8fPKN0A08fPKN1A08fPIN0A0e8ePHN2B0Y8fPIN0A0f8ePHN2B0[8fPIN0A0g.  By dragging you
can select any (nonempty) sublist of this list.  You can thus also select the
individual operators in this way.  For instance, positioning the pointer over the
symbol ``8fPHN2A0['' and making a very slight dragging motion selects just the operator
and nothing  more.  To select an operator such as the ``8fPHN2A0\'' which is very narrow
and close to its two arguments the best technique is to position the pointer over
the operator,  and click down but not release.  This will select the subexpression
8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0c8ePHN2B0\8fPIN0A0d.  Then drag  8fPIN2A0I8bONN0E1beyond this subexpression (to include say the adjacent ``8fPHN2A0Z'' in
the selection, or  even ``8fPJN0A08fPIN0A0b8ePHN2B0Z'') before bringing the pointer back to the ``8fPHN2A0\''.  

Clicking and dragging can be combined, and all that we have said has a similar
effect when used to select text rather than subexpressions.  Indeed, this is all so 
much easier to demonstrate than to explain in words, and is not as difficult as it 
may seem.  Selection of subexpressions is a fundamental technique in the use of
8fPHN2A02, so experimentation and perseverance (if necessary) have their
rewards.   Continue reading only when you feel you have mastered the 
technique.

For example, you will have noticed that 8fPHN2A02 is capable of handling
various fonts: section headings are in 8fPIN2A0E8bOLN0E1bold type, names of  console
buttons are 8fPIN2A0C8bO1BN0E1sans serif, and some words are 8fPIN2A0K8bO1BN0E1emphasised.  Now, if you select,
say,  ``8fPIN2A0K8bO1BN0E1emphasised''  the question is whether you have indeed selected the
emphasised word or the unemphasised word ``emphasised''.  Sometimes you
will want to  select the one, sometimes the other.  But which selection has been
made is not normally visible.   

The problems centre around the use of text as an argument to some function. 
(Think  of emphasising a segment of text.  The function is ``emphasise'' and the
segment is the argument.)   How can we distinguish between the text itself and
the function applied to the text?  Sometimes you might not even wish to see a
difference in the  final text between the argument and the function applied to
the argument, for  example if you want to index words in a text.  During the
preparation of the  document you will nevertheless most certainly wish to see
the difference, in order to be sure that the scope of the function is correctly set. 
(Those readers familiar  with the use of 8fPHN2A07 will know that a single missing
bracket can suddenly turn  the whole of their document from roman type into
italic type.)  

To alleviate these problems 8fPHN2A02 automatically brackets text arguments 
by a pair of raised dots.  Whether these are visible on your screen can be toggled
by holding down the 8fPIN2A0C8bOLN0E1Ctrl key on your keyboard and hitting the ``.'' key.  If dots
are visible around the several occurrences of 8fPIN2A0C8bOLN0E1Ctrl in this paragraph then
holding down the 8fPIN2A0C8bOLN0E1Ctrl key  and hitting the ``.'' key8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLHN@E4$8bMHN0E38bNHN0E28bO1PN0E1dots, showing and hiding will cause them all to
disappear.  If they are not visible the action will cause them to appear.

Make the dots appear.  You can now see whether you have selected the raw
word  ``Ctrl'' or the sans serif version by whether your selection excludes or
includes the surrounding dots.  Moving the mouse pointer to point at the word
followed by a  double click will give you the raw word, a treble click will give you
the sans serif word.

So
now is the time to learn something about the different types.   Since the technique
we are about to describe is most commonly used when selecting  large chunks of
text we suggest you  practise it on text.  Nevertheless,  all that we have  said so far
and are about to say is  equally applicable to both text and mathematical expressions.

This is probably an opportune moment to remind you that if you want to clear a
selection you should move the mouse pointer to a large area of white space 
within this edit window and then click on the appropriate mouse button.

Position the screen so that this sentence is at the very top.  Now, position the 
mouse pointer so as to point at the space between ``target'' and ``selection''  in 
the list below.  Do a double click with the near button: the effect is to set the 
target selection to the string ``target selection''.  You can see this because  the
string is then displayed in inverse video mode. 8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLHN0E48bMHN0E38bN1MN0E2visual representation8bO1AN0E1selection Repeat the action using the
middle and far buttons with the pointer positioned between ``source'' and
``selection'', and between ``argument'' and ``selection'', respectively.  On a
black-and-white screen, you will see that the source selection is indicated by a
thick underline, and the  argument selection by a thin underline.   On a colour
screen the  source selection is shaded blue, and the argument selection purple. 
(These colours may vary, and can be altered to suit your own taste.  The
important thing is to note for yourself how the different selections are
indicated.)

the colour alongside each item.   Rename the file to something like ``MyTutorial''
and save it in your own directory.) 

If you now look among all the menus you were asked to pin up earlier you 
should be able to locate the menu item 8fPIN2A0C8bOLN0E1Join.   (If you can't find it, pull up
the menu once more by clicking on the  8fPIN2A0C8bO1AN0E1Selection button on the console with
the far mouse button.  Pin the menu up by selecting its title.  
The selections you have already made will not be lost in this process.)
Mostly you will only use the target and source selections. 8fPIN2A0C8bOLN0E1Join  is, however, one
of the few operations that makes use of the argument  selection.  

The function of 8fPIN2A0C8bOLN0E1Join is to extend a selection.  Next to the word ``8fPIN2A0C8bOLN0E1Join'' in the
pop-up menu is  a triangle pointing to the right.  This is the standard convention
for indicating that there is a  collection of options from which to choose.  With
the mouse pointing at 8fPIN2A0C8bOLN0E1Join8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLIN0E48fPIN2A0C8bOLN0E1Join8bMLN0E3Join8bN1EN0E2operations on8bO1AN0E1selection and holding down the far button, drag the mouse to
the right and the options will be revealed.  Moving the  mouse vertically whilst
continuing to hold the far button down allows you to choose the option you want.
 
There are three options to be chosen from.  The option ``8fPKN0A08fPKN0A08fPINPA0'T8ePHN2B0ISafa0e20I# -&0GVafa0e20C#"CC+IC{\plus}GVafa0e20D#"CC×EC{×}GVafa0e20E#"CC25bPGC\juncGVafa0e20F#"CC25bFHC\splitGVafa0e20G#"CC25bEJC\cosplitGVafa0e20H#"CC25bOIC\cojuncd8fPINPA0'A8ePHN2B0ISff204c6B# +'0GVff204c5L!"CC219CGVff204c5M#"CC1ffDNC\natrightrelGVff204c5N!"CC219NGVff204c5O#"HC81K*81L219C81M81N1AC\stackrel{221H}{219C}GVff204c5P#"NC 81J ccA8fO80P81L219C81H81M81N 1MC\rTeXto[l>=0.8em]^{8fO}\relaxGVff204c6A#"IC81K219C81H81L8fO81M81N1DC\overrightarrow{8fO}GVaf57681F!"CC21aGk8fPINPA0'T''  joins the
target and argument  selections.  The joined selection becomes the new target.
The option ``8fPKN0A08fPKN0A08fPINPA0'S8ePHN2B0d8fPINPA0'A8ePHN2B0k8fPINPA0'S''  joins the source and argument  selections, the joined
selection becoming the new source. Finally, the option ``8fPKN0A08fPKN0A08fPINPA0'A8ePHN2B0d8fPINPA0'S8ePHN2B0k8fPINPA0'A''  joins the
argument and source  selections, the joined selection becoming the new
argument. 

Try it out on the paragraph above.  On plain text the effect should be predictable. 
Note carefully, however, what happens when you join substructures of two
disjoint structures. (For instance if you set the target to the second  8fPIN2A0C8bOIN0E1T and the
argument to the last 8fPIN2A0C8bOIN0E1S above,  and then join them, you will find that the selection
immediately extends so as to  include the first  8fPIN2A0C8bOIN0E1T and the last 8fPIN2A0C8bOIN0E1A.)

One final point.  If you are working simultaneously with two or more 
documents there is still only one selection8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLHN0E48bMHN0E38bN1FN0E2number allowed8bO1AN0E1selection of each type available.  This is to enable
parts of one document to be copied over into, or swapped  with, parts of another
document.  8fPIN2A0C8bOLN0E1Join does not join selections in different documents!  If one of the
required selections is not set in the current document then it has no effect.

Both will only work if the menu is pinned up because their action depends on which
mouse button is used.  Clicking on 8fPIN2A0C8bOMN0E1Clear  will clear the selection corresponding to
the mouse button that is used.  Clicking on 8fPIN2A0C8bOLN0E1Swap with the near button will swap the

8fPKN2A0*8bMHN@E3"8bO2CN0E1Manipulating Subexpressions8bNIN0E28fPHN2A0/The primary goal of  8fPHN2A02 is  to provide a pleasant, useable interface for 
performing algebraic calculations at a computer terminal.  The argument for 
using a computer for such calculations rather than doing them by hand is a
very  simple one:  computers are able to copy information very reliably and
quickly  whereas human beings tend to introduce mistakes in the process.  

Apart from being able to copy subexpressions easily and quickly, 8fPHN2A02 
provides simple-to-use functions for rearranging expressions, and for finding 
and replacing mathematical expressions of a given structure.  There are few 
restrictions on the use of these functions.  The principle is that the user knows 
what he/she is doing, and 8fPHN2A02 is simply there to carry out instructions. 
There is  however one exception, namely,  you cannot perform any operation that
would result in text being placed where a mathematical expression is expected. 
For example, there are restrictions  on interchanging an  expression and a
portion of text.  This does not mean to say that text cannot  appear in
mathematical formulae: it is vital that it can.  It does mean that, via the  stencil
definition mechanism, one must explicitly state where text may be inserted in an
expression.  Bear this in mind when experimenting with the functions  described
in this section.

These are
the target selection8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLHN0E48bMHN0E38bNNN0E2target8bO1AN0E1selection, the source selection8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLHN0E48bMHN0E38bNNN0E2source8bO1AN0E1selection  and the argument selection8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLHN0E48bMHN0E38bNPN0E2argument8bO1AN0E1selection. These
selections are made using the near, middle and  far mouse buttons, respectively.  
Now is the time to appreciate the meaning of  these terms.  

The target selection is where changes to the text occur.  With one exception ---the
8fPIN2A0C8bOLN0E1Swap  function which swaps the target and source terms--- you may
rely  on the fact that the effect of 8fPHN2A02 functions is localised to the target
selection only.  The source selection determines how the target selection will be
affected.   The argument selection is typically used to specify the scope of the
function that is being applied.  

It is important that you accustom yourself to which selection is which.  For those
readers who skipped over 8fPJN2A0X8bNPN0E2Tutorial8bO1JN0E1Joining Selections here is the information once

argument selection by a thin underscore on a black-and-white monitor and
purple shading on a colour monitor.  Set all three now so that you see what is
meant.  First set the three selections to 8fPIN2A0K8bOPN0E1disjoint areas of text.  (Click and drag with
the appropriate mouse button anywhere you like.)  Then look to see what happens

source, overlapping target  and argument, overlapping source and argument, and
all three overlapping.   Try out all four.)  The effect is self-evident when you see it
but much harder to  describe in words so we leave it to you to experiment.  (That
isn't completely true:   if you are au fait with systems jargon you will immediately
recognise the  combination of a number selections as just their exclusive-or.)

The expression is incomplete: it contains an expression place holder8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLHN@E4$8bMHN0E38bNHN0E28bO1DN0E1place holder indicated by
a boldface 8fPIN2A0E8bOIN0E1E.  This is just so that you can practise copying.  Set the target
selection  to the ``8fPIN2A0E8bOIN0E1E'' in the expression and the source selection to any
subexpression.  Then click on  8fPIN2A0C8bOLN0E1Copy. (If you haven't pinned the appropriate 
menu up, you will find it under the 8fPIN2A0C8bONN0E1EditOp  button on the   console.) The source
selection will be copied into the place holder; the target selection becomes the
expression you have  just copied. If you do not alter the target selection at any
stage you can return to  the original state by pressing the ``Delete'' key on your
keyboard.  Repeat the  procedure as often as you like.  (Instead of using 8fPIN2A0C8bOLN0E1Copy 
you may find it more convenient to use the ``F7'' key on your keyboard.   Both
have the same effect.)  Don't be afraid to copy a subexpression that itself  contains
the place holder 8fPIN2A0E8bOIN0E1E.  The copy action is not recursive so you will not send
8fPHN2A02 into an infinite loop!  Note that 8fPHN2A02 sometimes inserts 
parentheses, and sometimes not.  Parentheses are not inserted if you copy an 
identifier  or the subexpression 8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B0\8fPIN0A0b into the place holder.  The latter is because the 
multiplication operator has been defined in the stencil for this manual to be an 
infix operator.  Parentheses are inserted if you copy say the  subexpression 8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B0Z8fPIN0A0b
into the place holder.   This is because ``8fPIN0A0+'' has been defined to have a lower 
precedence than ``8fPHN2A0\''.  Note also that the spacing around the operators8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLHN0E48bMHN0E38bN1FN0E2spacing around8bOPN0E1operator grows as 
the expression you create becomes more complex.

You do not need to set the target selection to an expression place holder to
perform a copy operation.  (What we now have to say holds true in general.)  If
the target selection is an existing expression then the source selection will
simply overwrite the target selection.  If, for example, you select 8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B0\8fPIN0A0b as the
target, and 8fPJN2A0u8fOKN1A18fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B0Z8fPIN0A0b8fNIN0A23 as  the source, copying will result in the expression below.

The overwritten expression is not lost.  It is copied to a buffer8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLHN@E4$8bMHN0E38bNHN0E28bONN0E1buffer.  The buffer can be
opened by clicking on the 8fPIN2A0C8bONN0E1Buffer entry (under the 8fPIN2A0C8bONN0E1Window button on the  console). 
The buffer  window is just like a normal   document window except that you can't
save its  contents between sessions.  If you have overwritten8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLHN@E4$8bMHN0E38bNHN0E28bOLN0E1undo an expression (or text)
by  mistake you can always recover it  by copying it from the buffer back into your  
document.  (Remember that the different selections do not have to be in the same
window.) 

As its name suggests,  8fPIN2A0C8bOLN0E1Swap8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLIN0E48fPIN2A0C8bOLN0E1Swap8bMLN0E3Swap8bN1GN0E2edit operations8bO1BN0E1expression  swaps the target and the source terms. (This is the
only time that anything other than the  target  is altered by an edit function.)  
8fPIN2A0C8bOLN0E1Swap can be used to swap text or expressions. Text can also be swapped
with a mathematical  expression provided that the expression is not a
subexpression of another expression. (In other words, text and expressions can be
swapped only where it is logical to do so.) 

8fPHN2A02 doesn't  always get the parenthesisation right when new
expressions are created.  For  example, try swapping 8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B0Z8fPIN0A0b and the superscript  8fPIN0A03
 in the expression 8fPJN2A0u8fOKN1A18fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B0Z8fPIN0A0b8fNIN0A23. Without changing the selections repeat the swap
operation.  Two swaps like this should have no effect on the text but instead you
obtain 8fPJN2A0u8fOKN0A18fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B0Z8fPIN0A0b8fNIN0A23.  The parentheses around 8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B0Z8fPIN0A0b have disappeared!  You can't really
blame 8fPHN2A02 for this because most of us would not wish to parenthesise  8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B0Z8fPIN0A0b 
in the intermediate expression 8fPJN2A0u8fOIN0A138fNKN0A28fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B0Z8fPIN0A0b. Similarly, if 8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B0Z8fPIN0A0b is a subscript to 8fPIN0A03 as in 8fPJN2A0s8fNKN0A28fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B0Z8fPIN0A0b8fOIN0A13 
we wouldn't want to   parenthesise 8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B0Z8fPIN0A0b. The rules that we use  for
parenthesisation are non-trivial,  and based as much on the visual appearance 
as the mathematical structure of  formulae.   Since computers are not endowed
with sight one can only expect that  things sometimes go wrong.  The solution
that 8fPHN2A02 adopts is to place the  responsibility fairly and squarely on the
user's shoulders.  You are expected to  read and check the result of any edit
operation you have executed.  In the case of  missing parentheses there is a
menu item 8fPIN2A0C8bO1BN0E1Add/Rem () (under the 8fPIN2A0C8bO1AN0E1Structure button on the  console) that  allows
you to insert them.  Set the target selection to the subexpression you want to 
parenthesise and then select this item.  The parentheses will then appear.  
If  8fPHN2A02 inserts parentheses that you don't want you can remove them
with the  same menu item.   (Sometimes nothing happens when you do this except
that the  screen flickers.  In that case you can oblige 8fPHN2A02 to remove the
parentheses  by holding down the ``Control'' key on your keyboard whilst
clicking8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLHN@E4$8bMHN0E38bNHN0E28bO1MN0E1parentheses, removing 8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLHN0E48bMHN0E38bN2BN0E2parenthesisation, removing8bO1BN0E1expressionon  8fPIN2A0C8bO1BN0E1Add/Rem ()8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLIN0E48fPIN2A0C8bO1BN0E1Add/Rem ()8bM1BN0E3Add/Rem ()8bN1GN0E2edit operations8bO1BN0E1expression.  The structure of the expression is
unchanged by either the  insertion or removal of parentheses.)  By the way, you
can also impose your own will on the spacing within formulae. We won't go into
details here ---refer to 8fPJN2A0W8bNHN@E2"8bO1GN0E1ConsoleCommands for that---  but the  general
message is: you're the boss and can always override 8fPHN2A02's actions, and
you bear the responsibility.

 8fPKN2A0*8bMHN@E3"8bO1BN0E18fPIN2A0C8bOON0E1Reverse, 8fPIN2A0C8bO1BN0E1Distribute and 8fPIN2A0C8bO1AN0E1Factorise8bNIN0E28fPHN2A0.Infix operators play a vital rôle  in mathematical formulae.  This is due in no 
small measure to the relative importance of associativity among all the 
algebraic properties that an operator may enjoy.  Because of the associativity of
an operator like addition we can freely write, say, 8fPON0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B0Z8fPIN0A0b8ePHN2B0Z8fPIN0A0c8ePHN2B0Z8fPIN0A0d without fear of
confusion.  This is of great benefit to calculation because the notation is not 
biased to any particular grouping of the subexpressions.  The exploitation of
associativity in a calculation becomes an invisible step, one that we are often not 
consciously aware of.  

A similar phenomenon lies at the heart of the use of infix notation for transitive 
relations.  When we write, say,  8fPMN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN6B0AISafa0e22G# %$0GVafa0e22C!"CC=GVafa0e22D!"IC80G80F

because of the transitivity of equality, it is also the case that 8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN6B0Az8fPIN0A0c.   In an
extended calculation in which several steps occur it is typically the equality
between the first and last terms that one is interested in,  the intermediate
terms being only of passing interest.  At the end of such a calculation it is
nonetheless rare to see  explicitly stated ``and hence, 8fPIN2A0K8bO2DN0E1by transitivity of equality,
the first and last terms are  equal''.  Such would only happen in a very
elementary mathematical text, or in an  extremely detailed (and pedantic)
logical argument.  The infix notation encourages us to 8fPIN2A0K8bO1AN0E1associate the first and
last terms with each other. 

Several elements of  8fPHN2A02 are geared to the use of infix notation in the two
ways explained above.  When creating a  stencil it is possible to
declare that an operator is ``infix''.  This means that the  operator can have a list
of arguments, of arbitrary finite length, whereby the  notation used to denote the
application of the operator to a list is to repeatedly write  the operator between
successive elements in the list of arguments.  Thus 8fPMN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN6B0AZ8fPIN0A0b8ePHN6B0AZ8fPIN0A0c    denotes the

the operator 8fPIN0A08ePHN2B0ISafa0e26K% !!0GVafa0e26J!"CC21dC9D has been declared to be right associative then the expression

will select the whole  expression, and you cannot select the subexpression8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN6B0A9D8fPIN0A0b.  
You can, however, select 8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN6B0A9D8fPIN0A0b by dragging.  This should be contrasted with the
situation in which  8fPIN0A08ePHN2B09D is declared to be associative.  Clicking on the leftmost ``8fPIN0A08ePHN2B09D''
selects 8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN6B0A9D8fPIN0A0b whilst dragging or a double click is needed to select the whole
expression.   This is the only  difference between ``left/right associative''
operators and ``infix''8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLHN0E48bMHN0E38bNMN0E2infix8bOPN0E1operator operators in  8fPHN2A02. Our own advice would be to

right associative, but the latter feature  has been retained for those who do not
wish to follow our advice.)

under the 8fPIN2A0C8bO1AN0E1Structure button on the console.)

The function 8fPIN2A0C8bOON0E1Reverse  reverses the order of the elements in a list of
arguments and (associative) infix operators.  Try it out on the following
expression:

First, by pointing at the individual operators in turn and clicking, note that there
is no hidden tree structure present in the expression.  It is just a list of variables 
(8fPIN0A0a to 8fPIN0A0e) separated by comparison operators.  By dragging you may
therefore select any sublist of the list.  For the moment don't try to be nasty;
select a sublist that  begins and ends with a variable.  Then click on 8fPIN2A0C8bOON0E1Reverse. 
All the elements of the list you have selected will be
reversed 8fPIN2A0K8bO2KN0E1including the comparison  operators.  Thus, if you select the subexpression
8fPMN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN6B0A9L8fPIN0A0b8ePHN6B0A9J8fPIN0A0c the effect will be to  create the following expression.

89P1AN0A08fPIN0A0c8ePHN6B0A9J8fPIN0A0b8ePHN6B0A9L8fPIN0A0a8ePHN6B0Bz8fPIN0A0d8ePHN6B0A9L8fPIN0A0e

Note that not only has the order of 8fPIN0A0a, 8fPIN0A0b and 8fPIN0A0c  been reversed but also the order of
8fPHN6A0A9L   and 8fPHN2A09J.    Now do try to be nasty.  Select a sublist that doesn't begin and end
with a variable.   You will discover that the syntactic structure ---expressions
separated by operators---  remains intact.  Within this constraint 8fPHN2A02
reverses as much as possible of the list you have selected.  

You may be disappointed that 8fPHN2A02 does not also reverse the symbols used
to  denote the comparison operators as well.  (Thus reversing the whole
expression should give 8fP1AN0A08fPIN0A0e8ePHN6B0A9K8fPIN0A0d8ePHN6B0Bz8fPIN0A0c8ePHN6B0A9I8fPIN0A0b8ePHN6B0A9K8fPIN0A0a.) Such a feature has not been
implemented. You can always edit the individual operators yourself by hand
after having reversed the list.  It is sometimes tedious, but it can be useful to
check through what you have got as you do it.

Here is another expression for you to experiment on.  The point to note is that 
8fPIN2A0C8bOON0E1Reverse is not recursive: it does not reverse subexpressions of the expression
you  have selected.

So much for the 8fPIN2A0C8bOON0E1Reverse function.8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKIN0E5)8bLIN0E48fPIN2A0C8bOON0E1Reverse8bMON0E3Reverse8bN1GN0E2edit operations8bO1BN0E1expressionLet us now discuss 8fPIN2A0C8bO1BN0E1Distribute8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJNN0E6textrm8bKIN0E5(8bLIN0E48fPIN2A0C8bO1BN0E1Distribute8bM1BN0E3Distribute8bN1GN0E2edit operations8bO1BN0E1expression  and

The functions
can  be useful in  other situations too.   One such situation arises when
attempting to prove an equality,  say 8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN6B0Az8fPIN0A0c.  Not knowing from which side to
begin, or suspecting that induction  may be necessary at some stage, one might
hedge one's bets and calculate with the  equality 8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN6B0Az8fPIN0A0c as follows.

It is no hardship when working with 8fPHN2A02 to repeatedly copy ``8fPJN0A08ePHN2B0z8fPIN0A0c'' even if the
expression ``8fPIN0A0c'' is quite complicated.  Doing so also helps you to keep track of
what it  is you are heading for.  On completion of the calculation, however, you
may decide  that it would be more helpful to a reader if the ``8fPJN0A08ePHN2B0z8fPIN0A0c'' were omitted. 
You can do this  as follows.  First, factorise  ``8fPJN0A08ePHN2B0z8fPIN0A0c'' from the
expression (using the  technique to be explained shortly).   This results in

89PKN0G08fPMN1A08fPIN0A0a8ePJN2B0©8eOHN2B1­8bN1DN0E2reason why 8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN6B0Az8fPIN0A0b8fPIN0A0b8ePJN2B0©8eOHN2B1­8bN1DN0E2reason why 8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0b8ePHN6B0Az8fPIN0A0c8fPIN0A0c8ePHN6B0Az8fPIN0A0c

Then set the target selection to the whole expression and the source selection to
the subexpression within parentheses and click on 8fPIN2A0C8bOLN0E1Copy.  You obtain:

89PMN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePJN2B0©8eOHN2B1­8bN1DN0E2reason why 8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN6B0Az8fPIN0A0b8fPIN0A0b8ePJN2B0©8eOHN2B1­8bN1DN0E2reason why 8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0b8ePHN6B0Az8fPIN0A0c8fPIN0A0c

Now with 8fPIN2A0C8bOLN0E1Find (to be explained in 8fPJN2A0V8bNPN0E2Tutorial8bO1HN0E1Find and Replace) you can replace all 
occurrences of ``8fPHN2A0­'' in your proof by ``8fPHN2A0z'' and you are done.

The fact that the intermediate steps in this edit process do not make
mathematical  sense should be of no concern to you.  Indeed in order to exploit
the capabilities of  8fPHN2A02 to the full you must learn to view calculation
purely and simply as  a game with (structured) sets of meaningless symbols.

The simplest way to use 8fPIN2A0C8bO1BN0E1Distribute  is as follows.  Suppose you have an expression
consisting of a function applied to an expression where the  argument to the
function is some infix operator applied to a list of expressions.    For example, the
expression 
89PKN0G08fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B0\8fPMN1A08fPIN0A0b8ePHN2B0Z8fPIN0A0c8ePHN2B0Z8fPIN0A0d
comprises the function 8fPJN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B0\ applied to the argument 8fPMN0A08fPIN0A0b8ePHN2B0Z8fPIN0A0c8ePHN2B0Z8fPIN0A0d.  Set the target  selection
to the whole expression and the source selection to the function's argument. 
In the above example set the
target to 8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B0\8fPMN1A08fPIN0A0b8ePHN2B0Z8fPIN0A0c8ePHN2B0Z8fPIN0A0d and the source to 8fPMN0A08fPIN0A0b8ePHN2B0Z8fPIN0A0c8ePHN2B0Z8fPIN0A0d.  Ensure that the argument 8fPIN2A0K8bO1AN0E1selection is
not set. (Otherwise the procedure described in the next paragraph will be followed.)  
Now click on 8fPIN2A0C8bO1BN0E1Distribute in the 
console.  The target  will be  modified in such a way that the function is
``distributed'' over the argument.   Try  it out on the expression displayed above.  
You should get what you expect to get, namely 8fPMN0A08fPKN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B0\8fPIN0A0b8ePHN2B0Z8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B0\8fPIN0A0c8ePHN2B0Z8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B0\8fPIN0A0d.  

The simple procedure just described is not adequate in all circumstances.  In 
general, there are two components to a  8fPIN2A0C8bO1BN0E1Distribute  or 8fPIN2A0C8bO1AN0E1Factorise operation, the 
target selection and a 8fPIN2A0K8bOPN0E1function that is distributed over,  or factorised out of,  the 
target selection. Sometimes, as in the example above, the function is a part of the
target itself,  but this may not always be the case.  In the more general case  both
the source and argument selections are used to specify the function.  The two 
are set so that the argument selection is a subexpression of the source selection; 
the function is then the difference between the two.  Try this out as follows.  Set
the  target selection to the entire expression displayed below.  Set the source

The general rule is that the function part of a 8fPIN2A0C8bO1AN0E1Factorise8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLIN0E48fPIN2A0C8bO1AN0E1Factorise8bM1AN0E3Factorise8bN1GN0E2edit operations8bO1BN0E1expression or 8fPIN2A0C8bO1BN0E1Distribute8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLIN0E48fPIN2A0C8bO1BN0E1Distribute8bM1BN0E3Distribute8bN1GN0E2edit operations8bO1BN0E1expression operation is
the difference between the source and the argument selections when the latter
is a subexpression of the former.  If the argument selection is not a
subexpression of the source (including when the argument is not set) then the
source must be a subexpression of the target, and the difference between these
two is used as the function.  The source must always be a complete expression. 
Thus in the above example it is not possible to define the function part by setting the 
source to 8fPJN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B0\.

This method of specifying a function is typically very convenient  but it is of
course  not complete.  For instance it is not possible to specify the function
mapping 8fPIN0A0x to 8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0x8ePHN2B0Z8fPIN0A0x in this way.  In such circumstances you will have to
perform the operation by hand.  Sorry!

There is another aspect of  8fPIN2A0C8bO1AN0E1Factorise that may at first seem surprising. 
Suppose  we take as target the expression 

89PKN0A08fPKN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B0\8fPIN0A0b8ePHN2B0Z8fPIN0A0c

With the aid of the source and argument selections, set  ``8fPJN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B0\'' as the
function to be factorised out.  Now click on 8fPIN2A0C8bO1AN0E1Factorise.  One might expect 8fPHN2A02
to refuse in some way ---  an angry beep or rebuff of the sort ``How stupid can 
you get, I can't factorise the given subexpression'' (but perhaps more tactfully 
stated).  Instead one obtains the expression:

89PKN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B0\8fPKN1A08fPIN0A0b8ePHN2B0Z8fPIN0A0c

Try it again with the following target expressions

89PON0A08fPKN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B0\8fPIN0A0b8ePHN2B0Z8fPIN0A0c8ePHN2B0Z8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B0\8fPIN0A0d8ePHN2B0Z8fPIN0A0e
89PKN0A08fPIN0A0b8ePHN2B0Z8fPIN0A0c

In each case an expression is created of the form 8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B0\8fPHN0A0 where  the subexpression 8fPHN0A0 is the
original target  with all occurrences of  ``8fPJN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B0\'' removed.

The design decision underlying this effect is that 8fPHN2A02 functions should be 
8fPIN2A0K8bOMN0E1total, so far as possible.   No angry beeps, no remonstrances.  We, as designers
of  8fPHN2A02,  cannot predict how others might wish to exploit the system, and
we  certainly do not wish to 8fPIN2A0K8bOON0E1dictate how the system should be used.  

We conclude this discussion of distribution and factorisation8fPON2A088bIIN0E7)8bJNN0E6textrm8bKHN0E58bLIN0E48fPIN2A0C8bO1AN0E1Factorise8bM1AN0E3Factorise8bN1GN0E2edit operations8bO1BN0E1expression with a slightly more
complicated example.  Suppose we want to include a step in a calculation of the
following form:

89PKN0A08fPIN2A08F8fOKN0A18fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B08L8fPIN0A0b8ePJN2B0©8eOHN2B1z8bN1DN0E2set calculus8fPKN0A08fPIN2A08F8fOIN0A1a8ePHN6B0AISff204c0L# &$0GVff204c0H!"CC229EGVff204c0I!"CC229DGVff204c0J!"CC222JGVff204c0K!"CC222K®8fPIN2A08F8fOIN0A1b

We assume that you have a set-calculus stencil for all the notational elements
in the calculation.  Using your stencil you can, of course, enter the whole step by
hand, not making any use of 8fPIN2A0C8bO1BN0E1Distribute.   There may however be
circumstances in which that would be quite cumbersome to do --- for example
if the list of elements in the set is quite long and contains complicated
expressions.  

The step  clearly involves a distributivity property, but not so straightforward as 
distributivity of multiplication over addition.  The way to proceed is as follows. In
your calculation you will already have the line

89PIN2G08F8fOKN0A18fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B08L8fPIN0A0b

You would now extend the calculation by choosing in a ``proof'' stencil your own
favourite notation for a calculational step.  The notation used above is the
favourite  of the designers of 8fPHN2A02 so that is what we will use here.  Taking
the  appropriate action (i.e. selecting the expression with the target selection and
clicking on the correct notation) we get the template

89PKN0A08fPIN2A08F8fOKN0A18fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B08L8fPIN0A0b8ePJN2B0©8eOHN0B18bNIN0E28fPIN2A0E8bOIN0E1T8fPHN0A0

in which all of  8fPIN2A0E8bOIN0E1O,  8fPIN2A0E8bOIN0E1T  and 8fPIN2A0E8bOIN0E1E are place holders (for operator, text and
expression, respectively).  The equality sign, the hint and the subexpression
``8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B08L8fPIN0A0b'' are now  filled in so that the state of the calculation is as follows:

89PKN0A08fPIN2A08F8fOKN0A18fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B08L8fPIN0A0b8ePJN2B0©8eOHN2B1z8bN1DN0E2set calculus8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B08L8fPIN0A0b

Now we apply 8fPIN2A0C8bO1BN0E1Distribute.  The target is set to ``8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B08L8fPIN0A0b '' in the 8fPIN2A0K8bONN0E1bottom line of the 
calculation,  the source to ``8fPIN2A08F8fOKN0A18fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B08L8fPIN0A0b'' and the argument to ``8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0a8ePHN2B08L8fPIN0A0b '' in the 8fPIN2A0K8bOKN0E1top line of 
the calculation, and 8fPIN2A0C8bO1BN0E1Distribute is activated.8fPON2A088bIIN0E7)8bJNN0E6textrm8bKHN0E58bLIN0E48fPIN2A0C8bO1BN0E1Distribute8bM1BN0E3Distribute8bN1GN0E2edit operations8bO1BN0E1expression   (Try it.) The result is:

Not quite what we wanted.  But now the comma in the bottom line can be
selected (point at it and then drag a slight distance) and deleted (press the
``Backspace'' or ``Delete''  key on your keyboard).  The operator place holder
that then appears  can be filled in using a set-calculus stencil to obtain the
desired result, namely:

Like all authors, Gries and Schneider have their own style for presenting 
definitions, theorems etc., and their own notational conventions for constructing
mathematical expressions.  The Gries-Schneider stencil is in effect a 
syntax-directed editor for statements in their book.  (This is, of course, only 
partially true.  The stencil we have created contains only a small number of 
templates in order to illustrate the general idea.  Many more would be needed
for the complete book.  More importantly, not all the conventions used by Gries
and Schneider are peculiar to their own book.  For organisational reasons it is
better to create several stencils, each forming a logical unit.  For the examples
below we have made use of other stencils, in particular the latex stencil, in
addition to the  Gries-Schneider stencil.)

The proof of this theorem illustrates the use of several of the axioms given above. 
 The proof starts with the RHS of (8.22), because it has more structure.

Since the extract is rather long it will be impossible for you to keep it in view as you
read.  A copy has therefore been placed in a separate file called 
``GriesSchneiderExample''.  We suggest you pull up this file and place it  alongside
the current one.  In case you have forgotten here once more are the  instructions
for doing so:  Select  8fPIN2A0C8bOPN0E1Document  in the menu under 8fPIN2A0C8bONN0E1Window on the  console and, 
when a window appears, click on the 8fPIN2A0C8bOLN0E1Load  button.  Finally, select the entry

All  but the first of 
these sections define mathematical operators and their precedences.  The first 
section (the one labelled 8fPIN2A0Ý8bOLN0E1None) is used to define mathematical notations 8fPIN2A0K8bOKN0E1and
other  (not necessarily mathematical) conventions that are used in a document.

Ostensibly, nine conventional operators have been defined in the  stencil --- 
reading  from top to bottom, ¬ ,  226B , 222H , = , + , mul , . , 21dA  and  21dC .  (The
unconventional  operators  [8fPIN2A0E8bONN0E1V := 8fPIN2A0E8bOIN0E1E]  and 8fPIN2A0E8bOKN0E1O232J8fPIN2A0E8bOIN0E1T232K will be discussed shortly.) 
The first is a prefix  operator, the next five are infix  operators, the next two are 
left-associative infix operators, and the last  a right-associative operator.   We say
``ostensibly'' because several of the operators have different ``versions''.  If for 
instance you move the mouse to point at ``222H'' in the stencil and press down with
the 8fPIN2A0K8bOKN0E1far mouse button a small menu will appear containing two items ``222H'' and
``222I''. The two operators have different meanings, of course, but according to the
definition in the stencil, they are treated by 8fPHN2A02 as different ``versions'' of
the same  operator8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLHN0E48bMHN0E38bN2AN0E2as a version in a stencil8bOPN0E1operator.  In fact the total number of operators defined in the stencil is
seventeen.  (Go through each in turn to see which have and which do not have 
different versions.    Before you can proceed you must either pin the menu up
---using the by now familiar technique of selecting the title---  or dismiss the
menu by pointing at one of the entries, pressing down the far mouse button, and
then moving the mouse pointer outside the menu before releasing the mouse
button.)

Each operator has been assigned a precedence according to a list to be found at
the  beginning of  Gries and Schneider's book8fPIN2A0M8bO9LN0E1The entry ``mul''
deviates  slightly from their book since it gives multiplication and division the
same  precedence.  This is of no relevance here..  Different versions of an

is very easy to add  new operators to the stencil or to modify existing definitions.

The first entry in the 8fPIN2A0Ý8bOLN0E1None section of the  Gries-Schneider stencil is labelled 
``rule''.   This template describes the style used by  Gries and Schneider to  present
rules.  Each rule typically has a 8fPIN2A0I8bOMN0E1label, a 8fPIN2A0I8bOLN0E1name, a 8fPIN2A0I8bO1AN0E1condition or
context under which the rule is valid, and the  8fPIN2A0I8bO1AN0E1statement of the rule itself.  In the
above example the label is ``8.22'', the name is ``8fPIN2A0E8bO1GN0E1Change of dummy'', the
condition is ``Provided  8fPJN0A08ePHN2B0Î8fPJN2A0Ï8fONN0A1occurs8fNKN0A28fPIN2A0Ð8fOIN0A1y8ePHN2B08L8fPIN2A0Ð8fOKN0A18fPIN0A0R8ePHN2B08L8fPIN0A0P and 8fPIN0A0f has an inverse'', and the

Clicking on ``rule'' in the stencil with the near mouse button
causes the following template to appear in your document at the location of the 
target selection:

89PLN2G0Í8bOIN0E18fPIN2A0E8bOMN0E1label8bNIN0E28fPIN2A0E8bOIN0E1T8bMIN0E38fPIN2A0E8bOIN0E1T8fLHN0A4

The bold ``8fPIN2A0E8bOMN0E1label'' and the two bold ``8fPIN2A0E8bOIN0E1T'' 's  are place holders for text; the bold ``8fPIN2A0E8bOIN0E1E''  is a
place holder for a mathematical expression.  

This template illustrates two ways of reminding oneself of the function of a place holder in
a template.  Both ways are intended to facilitate the process of 8fPIN2A0K8bOON0E1writing a document 
without compromising the quality of the finished product.

The first way is to give place holders a name:  ``8fPIN2A0E8bOMN0E1label'' is a named place
holder8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLHN0E48bMHN0E38bNMN0E2named8bO1DN0E1place holder and can be replaced by an arbitrary text.  It reminds the writer that a label is
needed and where it should be entered.  

A characteristic of named place holders is that the name disappears as soon as anything is
entered into the place holder.  This can be an advantage, for instance in order to avoid
clutter in the  on-screen view of a document, but it can also be a disadvantage.  In the
latter case one can add explanatory information to the screen view of a template which is
then discarded in the generated output.  This, the second way of reminding oneself of the
function of a place holder, is illustrated by the use of the headings ``8fPIN2A0E8bOLN0E1Name'', ``Condition:''
and ``Statement:'' together with the unnamed place holders ``8fPIN2A0E8bOIN0E1T'' and ``8fPIN2A0E8bOIN0E1E''. In Gries and
Schneider's book  these headings do not appear.  The point is that the template can always
be defined so that the headings 8fPIN2A0K8bOJN0E1do appear on the screen8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLHN0E48bMHN0E38bN1EN0E2screen output8bOON0E1stencil  but  do 8fPIN2A0K8bOKN0E1not appear in the
8fPHN2A07 output8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLPN0E48fPHN2A07 output8bMHN0E38bN1DN0E2LaTex output8bOON0E1stencil generated by the  document.  

It is sometimes the case that Gries and Schneider do not give a rule a name, or the
rule is unconditionally valid.  To accommodate these additional possibilities the
template has three versions.  You can see these versions by pointing at  ``rule'' in
the stencil, and then clicking with the far mouse button.  A  menu will appear
with three entries 8fPIN2A0C8bO2BN0E1Name, Condition, Statement,   8fPIN2A0C8bO1LN0E1Condition, Statement and
8fPIN2A0C8bO1GN0E1Name, Statement.  (There is also an entry 8fPIN2A0C8bOLN0E1Info8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bL1JN0E48fPIN2A0C8bOLN0E1Info about a template8bMHN0E38bNHN0E28bO1ON0E1Info about  a template  separated from the rest which, if
selected, provides further information on the template.  We return to this later.)
We suggest that you pin this menu up.  If you now press down on  either the near
or far mouse button  you can move the pointer to select one of the entries.    If you
release the mouse button whilst one of the items is selected then a template will
appear in your document at the position of the cursor.  (The menu will remain on
your screen if you had pinned it up earlier and will disappear if you hadn't pinned
it up.)  If you release when  none of the items is selected then the menu will
disappear and nothing will  happen to your document.  

The second entry in the Gries-Schneider stencil is labelled ``Quant.''.  This too
has several versions which you can examine by pointing at the entry and
pressing down on the far mouse button.  In the example above we in fact only
use one of  the versions, namely 8fPIN2A0C8bOIN0E18fPLN2A0Ô8fOHN0A18cNHN0D28fMHN0A38fLHN0A4.   This version has place holders
for four  entries, an 8fPIN2A0E8bOIN0E1Expression, a 8fPIN2A0E8bOIN0E1Variable, and two 8fPIN2A0E8bOIN0E1Expressions.  Try
selecting different components of the template displayed below:

89PLN2G0Ô8fOHN0A18cNHN0D28fMHN0A38fLHN0A4

You will find that you are unable to select the ``syntactic sugar''8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLHN0E48bMHN0E38bN1PN0E2unable to select part of8bOPN0E1template: the 
individual parentheses, the vertical bar and the colon. Only the four place 
holders and the entire expression can be selected.  

Now set one of the expression place holders to be the target selection.  Then,  with
the near mouse button, click on any entry in the stencil.  Repeat this as often as
you like and observe how the expression grows.   Observe also which parts of  the
expression can be selected and which not.   (If you are unfamiliar with the  term,
this is what is meant by ``syntax-directed editing''.)

The next entry in the 8fPIN2A0Ý8bOLN0E1None section of the stencil is  labelled 8fPIN2A0E8bOIN0E1E(8fPIN2A0E8bOIN0E1E).  
Clicking on  it (in the stencil window) with the near mouse button generates the
template 8fPJN2A0Ï8fOHN0A18fNHN0A2 at the position of the cursor in your  document. This
template has been  used to construct the expression 8fPJN2A0Ï8fONN0A1occurs8fNKN0A28fPIN2A0Ð8fOIN0A1y8ePHN2B08L8fPIN2A0Ð8fOKN0A18fPIN0A0R8ePHN2B08L8fPIN0A0P. 
Specifically, the first place  holder has been replaced by the expression 8fPNN0A0occurs
and the second place holder by  the expression 8fPKN0A08fPIN2A0Ð8fOIN0A1y8ePHN2B08L8fPIN2A0Ð8fOKN0A18fPIN0A0R8ePHN2B08L8fPIN0A0P. 

It is useful to compare the template 8fPIN2A0E8bOIN0E1E(8fPIN2A0E8bOIN0E1E) with the template labelled
8fPIN0A08ePJN2B0×8cOHN0D18fNHN0A2 in the stencil.  Clicking on the latter generates  8fPJN0A08fPHN0A08ePJN2B0×8cOHN0D18fNHN0A2 at the
position of the cursor in your document.   The additional ``8fPHN0A0'' at the beginning is
implicit in the fact that 8fPIN0A08ePJN2B0×8cOHN0D18fNHN0A2 is a postfix operator.   (Note: Operators8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLHN0E48bMHN0E38bNNN0E2symbol8bOPN0E1operator in
8fPHN2A02 needn't be single symbols; as illustrated here, they may be expressions
with arbitrary  structure.)   

The postfix operator 8fPJN2A0×8cOHN0D18fNHN0A2 has been defined to have the highest precedence of
all  the operators in the Gries-Schneider stencil.  (You can't see this from the 
information displayed on your screen.  You have to look at the ``8fPIN2A0C8bOLN0E1Info'' to find that
out.)  This means that whatever expression8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLHN0E48bMHN0E38bN1HN0E2parenthesisation8bO1BN0E1expression is entered as argument to the
operator it will be automatically parenthesised.  (There are two exceptions: if the
expression is just an identifier and if the expression is an instance of the same
postfix  operator.)   Expressions that are entered in the first place holder of the
template labelled 8fPIN2A0E8bOIN0E1E(8fPIN2A0E8bOIN0E1E) will never be parenthesised by 8fPHN2A02.  The
point is that the  automatic insertion of parentheses is applicable only to the
templates defined outwith  the 8fPIN2A0Ý8bOLN0E1None section8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLHN0E48bMHN0E38bN1HN0E2parenthesisation8bO1BN0E1expression8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bL2KN0E4\protect{8fPIN2A0Ý8bOLN0E1None} --- section in  stencil8bMHN0E38bNHN0E28bOLN0E1None. 8fPHN2A02 will never try to
parenthesise an expression that  occupies a place holder of  a template in the
8fPIN2A0Ý8bOLN0E1None section.   Typically, mathematical  operators defined in the 8fPIN2A0Ý8bOLN0E1None section
are multi-fix operators8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLHN0E48bMHN0E38bN1AN0E2multi-fix8bOPN0E1operator, and it is advisable as a general rule to ensure that every
place holder is bracketed on both sides by some  ``syntactic sugar''.  (This is
exemplified by the quantifier template.) If this is  unavoidable an effect will be
obtained that is comparable to defining a postfix8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLHN0E48bMHN0E38bNON0E2postfix8bOPN0E1operator, prefix8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLHN0E48bMHN0E38bNNN0E2prefix8bOPN0E1operator  or infix operator with
the lowest possible precedence. If in such cases you feel it  would be more
helpful to your reader to insert parentheses this can always be done  using the
8fPIN2A0C8bO1BN0E1Add/Rem () item in the menu under 8fPIN2A0C8bO1AN0E1Structure on the  console.

Instead of defining a postfix operator 8fPJN2A0×8cOHN0D18fNHN0A2 we could have defined a postfix 
operator 8fPIN2A08B8fOHN0A1 combined with an infix operator  := .  This is more flexible but has
the  disadvantage that more hand movements are necessary to enter an
expression.   A better solution is to enter both as ``versions'' of a template as
illustrated by the quantifier template discussed above. This is one argument for
the use of versions.    Frequently used instances of a general construction can be
entered as versions of the  construction and more quickly entered into a
document than by entering the general  version followed by the details of the
instantiation.  The main argument for versions  however is organisational.  It is
remarkable just how many different templates one  needs in even a small
document and the total size of one's stencil database grows  very rapidly.  Apart
from the fact that a computer screen is much, much smaller  than a desk and
can very quickly become clogged up, looking up the template you  want can
become time-consuming. Sensible use of versions and logically-organised 
stencils can make a world of difference.  8fPHN2A02 provides the tools.  How well
(or  badly) they are used is up to you.

The final operator in the Gries-Schneider stencil has the label ``8fPIN2A0E8bOKN0E1O232J8fPIN2A0E8bOIN0E1T232K''.  This
is an excellent example of the flexibility of the template notion in 8fPHN2A02. 


The template cannot be used for in-line mathematical expressions; it can only
be used in display  mode.  This is because its definition includes specific layout
requirements, in  particular that the operator's two arguments are to be placed
one above the other on separate lines.

To create a displayed expression you should set the target selection to an empty line
where you want the expression to be displayed.  Then select the  entry  8fPIN2A0C8bO1CN0E1Insert

the text like the one below.  The target  selection will be set to the ``8fPIN2A0E8bOIN0E1D''.

You don't need to create a new display in this document.  Just set the target

A place holder has been created for two expressions (8fPIN2A0E8bOIN0E1E), an operator (8fPIN2A0E8bOIN0E1O) and
text (8fPIN2A0E8bOIN0E1T). If you continue clicking on the same template you will find that the
pattern is  repeated.  Each time, you get one each of an extra expression,
operator and text place holder.  The template 8fPIN2A0E8bOKN0E1O232J8fPIN2A0E8bOIN0E1T232K behaves exactly like an

possible value.  If you enter  a particular operator in the operator place holder
(just click on one in the stencil)  then the precedence remains 0; the construction
does not adopt the precedence of the instantiated operator.

for how to redefine existing templates. By going  through the motions  of
redefining a template, but not making any change whatsoever, you can find out
full details of any template.

Two other mechanisms are provided in order to let you obtain information about
existing  templates.  The first is obtained via a selection in a 8fPIN2A0C8bOPN0E1Document window,
the second via a stencil. We consider both in turn.

Suppose you are reading a 8fPHN2A02  document, possibly written by someone
else,  and you  see that use has been made of a template.  You would like to find
out more about the template, for instance, in which stencil (or stencils) it is
defined.  In this document, for example, you will no doubt have noted that a
template has been used for sections and subsections.

precedence should be.   Thus an infix dot should have a high precedence whereas a
long arrow should have a low precedence.)  

The number of versions of the template is self-explanatory.  The number of
times the template has been used relates to the documents that are loaded at the
time the information is requested.  It also includes uses of the template in the
8fPIN2A0C8bONN0E1Buffer window and in the 8fPIN2A0C8bOLN0E1Find window.  (Thus, if you delete a template from a
document the number of uses will not change because the template is
automatically deposited in the buffer. ) 

Templates may be stored in more than one stencil.  The section ``Files'' lists the
names of all the stencils that are currently loaded in which the template has been
defined.  Often a dash (--) will appear in this entry indicating that the template8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLHN0E48bMHN0E38bN1JN0E2finding definition8bO1LN0E1template in document

nowhere defined, only that you haven't loaded any stencil containing its
definition.  If the creator of the template has been conscientious then the name of
the stencil will be included in the help file.  So, consult the help file first if the
template does not occur in any loaded stencil. Otherwise the definition of the
template is always accessible via the so-called  ``document stencil'': see

it can also be the most difficult task of all in the use of 8fPHN2A02.  It is very 
straightforward to enter simple mathematical operators.  The difficulties begin 
when you require special layout conventions.  The difficulties are compounded
when the 8fPHN2A07 automatically generated by 8fPHN2A02 is not adequate to your
needs. In this section we only outline the creation of templates and you are
referred to the  reference section for more details.

To create a new stencil click on 8fPIN2A0C8bOON0E1Stencil in the menu under 8fPIN2A0C8bONN0E1Window on the

console.  This window contains  several pages of mathematical
symbols which you can enter directly into your documents or use in the
definition of stencils.   

Defining templates is menu-driven.  The window opened by clicking on 8fPIN2A0C8bONN0E1Define
is  headed by a list of items.  The first three (``Kind'', ``Prec.'' and  ``Space'') must 
always be set.  When you open the window these items are already initialised to
the  default values ``None'',  0, and 0.

To enter, for example, the operators 229H, 229F, and 229I all as versions of one template
called, say, ``o.ops''  proceed further as follows.  First enter the name ``o.ops''.
(You can skip this step if you want.  If you don't supply a name 8fPHN2A02 will
create one for you.  All the names in the Gries-Schneider stencil were
created by 8fPHN2A02 except for ``rule'', ``Quant.'' and ``mul''.)  

Now select ``Kind'' and choose an item (for example ``Infix'')  from the menu that 
appears. After having done so  select  ``Prec.'' and
choose a number from the menu that appears.    

Now move the mouse pointer down into the  main window area and click.  The
three headings ``Screen'',  ``Latex''  and  ``Name'' will appear.  If you move the
mouse pointer below all three and click  again a second such entry will appear. 
Each of these entries forms a version of  the template you are defining.  

The ``Name'' field allows you to give an individual  name to each version.  (In this
case it will not be necessary to do that since the  name 8fPHN2A02 creates is
perfectly adequate.)  The ``Screen'' field lets you specify how the (version of the)
template is to be laid out on the screen, and the ``Latex'' field  specifies the 8fPHN2A07
code that is generated by each version of the  template in your document. 
 
For our example you would click in the ``Screen'' field in order to indicate that it
is that field you wish to edit.  Two cursors appear, one in the ``Screen'' field, the
other in the ``Latex'' field.  The two cursors indicate that  8fPHN2A02 will
automatically generate  8fPHN2A07 corresponding to whatever is entered in the screen
filed.  Then you would look up  the symbol 229H
in the symbol palette and click on it.  The symbol is copied to the  ``Screen'' entry
and the corresponding 8fPHN2A07 is automatically filled in in the ``Latex'' field.  This
process is then repeated for 229F and 229I.  

Clicking on 8fPIN2A0C8bOON0E1Install followed by 8fPIN2A0C8bOLN0E1Done in the 8fPIN2A0C8bONN0E1Define window completes the
operation.8fPON2A088bIIN0E7)8bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLHN0E48bMHN0E38bNPN0E2defining8bOPN0E1template

The limitations of the written word have obliged us to describe the above process
as a 8fPIN2A0K8bOPN0E1sequence of steps.  The steps may however be performed in any order.  

The remaining menu entries allow you to specify the default spacing around 
operators, to align different elements of a template, to specify the kind, size
and/or  font  of  individual place holders, and to draw variable length lines
alongside, above or below the elements of the template.  It is also possible to hide
elements of a  template on the screen (but then you should include a version of
the template in which the element is not hidden so that you can edit it!).  

In more complicated cases involving, for example,  alignment of different
elements or sub- or superscripting, the best advice is to look for a template that
approximates  the one that you want, and use that template as a blue-print.  You
can include an existing template in a new one just by clicking on the template
when the cursor is set in the 8fPIN2A0C8bONN0E1Define window.  The complete definition will be
copied across.

The three other buttons at the head of the 8fPIN2A0C8bONN0E1Define window --- 8fPIN2A0C8bONN0E1Modify, 8fPIN2A0C8bONN0E1Delete
and 8fPIN2A0C8bONN0E1Double allow you to edit a stencil.  8fPIN2A0C8bONN0E1Delete deletes the template that is loaded in
the 8fPIN2A0C8bONN0E1Define window, and 8fPIN2A0C8bONN0E1Modify changes the definition of the loaded template.
(You can see which template is loaded by looking at the ``Name'' entry.)  Take care
with 8fPIN2A0C8bONN0E1Modify and  8fPIN2A0C8bONN0E1Delete since there is no undo facility!  

The  8fPIN2A0C8bONN0E1Double button allows you to remove a duplicated entry in a stencil whilst at
the same time ensuring that all occurrences of the duplicate in loaded documents
are  identified with the original.  This is useful in case you need to integrate two or
more independently produced documents.    Suppose, for instance, you are writing 
a document in collaboration with a colleague.  Both you and your colleague define
independently a ``woggle'' template, say, for use in the sections of the document on
which you are working. Subsequently, the two sections are to be merged.  The
problem that you then face is that, although the two woggle templates may
produce exactly the same output,  8fPHN2A02 does not recognise them as being
the same.  (8fPHN2A02 uses a code number to identify templates, the number
being generated at the time of creation of the template.  The chances that the code
number given to two templates is the same is negligibly small.)  Any find
operation, for example, will find only one of them.  The solution is to first ensure
that the two templates are indeed identically defined and then, with one of the
templates loaded in the 8fPIN2A0C8bONN0E1Define window, click on 8fPIN2A0C8bONN0E1Double.   This  will update the code
number assigned to the loaded template to be identical to the code number
assigned to the other, both in the stencil and in all loaded documents.  Deleting the
template from the stencil leaves you with just the one instance, as required. 
Refer to the reference manual for the fine details before using this operation.


Using the definition facility is not so hard as we may seem to have made out.  In  practice
one doesn't do it very often so you will inevitably have to remind yourself of the
procedure by reading the reference manual whenever you do.8fPON2A088bIIN0E7)8bJNN0E6textrm8bKHN0E58bLHN@E4$8bMHN0E38bNHN0E28bOON0E1stencil

The 8fPIN2A0C8bOLN0E1Find  (and Replace) function is a very powerful and easy-to-use facility.  If

under the 8fPIN2A0C8bOLN0E1Find button at the head of the window.  The choices are 8fPIN2A0C8bOLN0E1Find, 8fPIN2A0C8bOON0E1Replace,
8fPIN2A0C8bO1DN0E1Replace8fPHN2A0ëFind and 8fPIN2A0C8bO1CN0E1Replace All.  For the 8fPIN2A0C8bOLN0E1Find operation it is, of course, not
necessary to specify a replacement.  8fPIN2A0C8bO1CN0E1Replace All is a global find-and-replace
facility.  Use it with great care!  Not only is it difficult to undo, it may also cause the
system to loop indefinitely.  

All find or find-and-replace  actions take place in the edit document in which
the target selection was last set and begin at the last such position of the target
selection. If the message ``Not found''8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLHN0E48bMHN0E38bN1AN0E2Not found8bO1HN0E1console message  appears in the console then check the
position of the target selection. Sometimes in the processing of specifying the
action it may be convenient to reset the target selection to another position in
the edit document or even in another document.  If you have done so, remember
to set the target to the position you want the search to begin from before
initiating the action.   (Resetting the target selection to within the
find-and-replace window is inevitable during the course of specifying a find or
find-and-replace action but  has no effect on the search process.) 

The fact that  the find and replace  windows are just like any other  document
window, whilst having the one slight disadvantage mentioned above, is otherwise
a major contribution to the ease of use of the facility.  Everything we have
explained above about editing expressions can be carried out in these windows. 
There are no limitations peculiar to find and replace.

There is one difference.  Whenever you create a place holder in the find or
replace window then it is numbered.  If  you create a place holder by copying a
numbered  place holder  then the number is copied too, otherwise 8fPHN2A02
creates a new number.  For instance it is possible to create the expression
8fPKN0A08fPIN2A0E8bOJN0E1E18ePHN2B0Y8fPIN2A0E8bOJN0E1E1 in the find window.  If you create the expression in the  normal way
8fPHN2A02 will create 8fPKN0A08fPIN2A0E8bOJN0E1E18ePHN2B0Y8fPIN2A0E8bOJN0E1E2. Now you can set the target to 8fPIN2A0E8bOJN0E1E2 and the 
source to 8fPIN2A0E8bOJN0E1E1 and copy the latter to the former thus creating the desired
expression. Searching for 8fPKN0A08fPIN2A0E8bOJN0E1E18ePHN2B0Y8fPIN2A0E8bOJN0E1E1 in your document will find all occurrences of
a repeated  mathematical expression where the two instances are separated by a
minus operator. (Spacing is ignored in this process.)  If you also enter 0 in the
replace window (and command the replacement to be made) the expression will
be simplified  according to the usual rule of arithmetic.  

The find-and-replace facility can in this way be used to make complicated 
mathematical transformations to an expression.  It is particularly useful when  a
large subexpression needs to be copied several times.  (A so-called ``complification''
step in a proof.  The use of find-and-replace in simplification steps, such as

You can also use find-and-replace to search for unfilled place holders8fPON2A088bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLHN0E48bMHN0E38bN1NN0E2unfilled place holders8bO1FN0E1find 8fPHN2A0ë replace.  A
``Delete'' operation in the find (or replace) window executed on a numbered
place holder will remove the number leaving behind an unnumbered place holder
of the same type.   Such unnumbered place holders match with 8fPIN2A0K8bOPN0E1unfilled
place holders in the document to be searched.   For example, entering a display place holder in the find window
will automatically enter the numbered place holder ``8fPIN2A0E8bOJN0E1D1''.  The find operation
will then seek all displayed expressions, including displayed expressions in which
the place holder is empty.  Selecting the display place holder and performing
delete will cause ``8fPIN2A0E8bOJN0E1D1'' to be replaced by ``8fPIN2A0E8bOIN0E1D''.  The find operation will then seek
just those displays in which the place holder is unfilled.

Unnumbered place holders in the replace window have a similar function:
the replacement is an empty place holder of the chosen type.  For example, if 
8fPKN0A08fPIN2A0E8bOJN0E1E18ePHN2B0Y8fPIN2A0E8bOJN0E1E2 is entered in the find window, and 8fPKN0A08fPIN2A0E8bOJN0E1E18ePHN2B0Y8fPIN2A0E8bOIN0E1E in the replace window, then
an expression such as 8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0x8ePHN2B0ISe12fcdbL# -"0GVe12fcdbM#"CC+IC{\plus}GVe12fcdbN!"CC-ï8fPIN0A0y will be replaced by 8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0x8ePHN2B0ï8fPHN0A0.  

The find-and-replace facility can, of course, be used for much more mundane
purposes.  For straight text an Emacs look-alike search and replace facility is
also provided.  



A very pleasant aspect of 8fPHN2A02's  find-and-replace is that you can always 
interrupt any sequence of such actions at any time --- without taking any
special steps.  If you are like us you will often find that during a global edit action
you spot other items in your document that should be altered, sometimes as a
consequence, sometimes not.  If so then just go ahead and make the changes! 
The  find-and-replace can always be resumed when you are ready, and you
don't have to key in some magic sequence of control characters to interrupt it.
