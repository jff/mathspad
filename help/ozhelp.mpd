One note on terminology. The oz stencil file contains many 8fPIN2A088bO1AN0E1templates; each template has a number
of 8fPIN2A088bOPN0E1versions. In some cases (especially when the first version is the basic one of which the others are
in some sense derived) I will call the second and latter versions 8fPIN2A088bO1DN0E1alternatives or 8fPIN2A088bOPN0E1variants. A

8fPIN2A018bO2BN0E1What to do before using oz
8fPIN2A098bOLN0E1Note added by Roland Backhouse:  Eerke included here a number of suggestions to avoid conflicts
between the names given by MathSpad 0.50 and the names given by  8fPIN2A0H8bONN0E1oz.sty
 to several commands.  We have incorporated all of his suggestions in release 0.60 so it should no
longer be necessary to do anything before using oz --- assuming we did the job correctly.  If any 
problems should occur blame us, not Eerke.

A serious change to the MathSpad set-up would be to include all the Z fonts in symbol
windows. How to do this is explained in the MathSpad manual, the fonts for Z are available
from Richard or possibly even in the distribution soon. I had two reasons not to hurry with that:
many of the special symbols are available on the stencil already, and some of the
special-kind-of-function symbols in oz are 8fPHN2A0C hacks that are not in any existing font
anyway.

One thing about 8fPIN2A0H8bONN0E1oz.sty that I have not figured out is why it provides alternative commands for
many operators if they are operators on schemas rather than on predicates. They do not seem to
look any different on the printed output, but just to be sure I have provided versions of these
operators which generate the schema versions of the 8fPHN2A0C commands. If you know and use the
difference, you can use them.
8fPJN2A028bO1EN0E1Documentstyle8bNPN0E2docstyleThe Style template in the standard 8fPHN2A0C stencil would do fine here, but for ease of use I have also
provided a Documentstyle template on the oz stencil which makes sure 8fPIN2A048bONN0E1oz.sty gets included.
There are three versions: 8fPIN2A098bO1AN0E1OzArticle, 8fPIN2A098bOJN0E1OzT and  8fPIN2A098bOJN0E1Oz[T]T which produce the obvious code.

8fPJN2A028bO2CN0E1Putting things side by side8bN1BN0E2sidebysideIt is probably not possible to write a generic MathSpad template for multiple column displays. The
8fPIN2A0H8bO1BN0E1SideBySide template does it just for two (default) and three columns, though I imagine it would
not be hard at all to write a version for any number you like, using the existing ones as an example.
Note, however, that MathSpad cannot do screen output in columns, so the MathSpad display looks
quite a bit different from the 8fPHN2A0C result. Example:

8fPIN2A018bO1HN0E1Schema templatesThere are many variations of schemas in Z. They are all drawn as boxes, but some have names
(written on the top line), some are split in two and some even have the top and bottom of the box
missing. Too further complicate matters, Z also allows one to write schemas ``inline'', in which case
there will not be a box at all.

The boxes are produced with various templates on the stencil, grouped in a way that will hopefully
appear as logical to you as it did to me at the time that I organised it (with one eye at Paul King's
``Printing Z and  Object-Z 8fPHN2A0C documents'', the 8fPIN2A048bONN0E1oz.sty manual). The inline variants are
generally the last version of any given template.

There is no separate template for generating the 8fPIN2A0H8bOKN0E1\ST of 8fPIN2A048bONN0E1oz.sty (which produces the line in the
middle of a box) -- instead there are separate templates for boxes with and without ``line''.
8fPJN2A0/8bO2NN0E1Multiple lines in a (section of) a box8bN1BN0E2multilinerThis deserves special attention, as one does not often create new lines by hand in 8fPHN2A0C math
mode. In 8fPIN2A048bONN0E1oz.sty, however, 8fPIN2A048bOJN0E1// in math mode is given the obvious meaning. I have had to write a
special template for this, called 8fPIN2A048bO1BN0E1multiliner on the stencil, which produces two expressions
separated by a newline. This is only meant for use 8fPIN2A088bONN0E1inside a box. Because MathSpad has no real
boxing possibilities, part of the left edge of the box is  produced before the second line of the two.
Outside a box it would look weird:

and if you use nested occurrences of multiliner, you will end up with strangely shifting left margins.
Do not worry, they are only there to remind you that you are actually inside a schema, and the
8fPHN2A0C code will come out just fine.

Besides the standard multiliner, there are also variants which introduce extra spacing, named after
their 8fPIN2A048bONN0E1oz.sty equivalents 8fPIN2A0H8bO1DN0E1\also, \Also and 8fPIN2A0H8bOMN0E1\ALSO (in increasing amounts of space).

The final variant, called 8fPIN2A048bO1DN0E1with tabbing, deserves separate mentioning. This is not a full-fledged
tabbing environment (since that requires quite a bit of hacking before it can be inserted in math
mode) nor does it use the 8fPIN2A0H8bONN0E1oz.sty tabbing-like commands 8fPIN2A0H8bOKN0E1\t1 etc or 8fPIN2A0H8bOJN0E1\M and 8fPIN2A0H8bOJN0E1\O for moving the
margins. It produces multiline formulas of the shape
8fPKN2A0N8fMHN0A38fNHN0A28fOHN0A1\\
in such a way that the third expression is aligned with the second. For example to produce

Note the bar in the screen display (not in the 8fPHN2A0C), and note that 
the second and third expression in this example had the left operand of the binary operator deleted.
Because this generates 8fPHN2A0C 8fPIN2A048bOMN0E1arrays of the appropriate shape, it should be possible to use this
version recursively (just like the other 8fPIN2A0H8bO1BN0E1multiliner versions).

The final version of this template may look a bit odd; but if you are writing a paper about Z with a
strict page limit you sometimes want to save space by combining short lines. Syntactically a newline
often has the same separator function as a semicolon in Z, so switching to this version allows you to
make that transition directly.

result as using the template (see the MathSpad manual).

For the brackets around tuple displays no special template is defined. The 8fPIN2A058bO1BN0E1Add/Rem () operation on
the main MathSpad 8fPIN2A058bO1AN0E1Structure menu will do the job. As you probably know, brackets necessary
because of priorities of operations will be automatically inserted by MathSpad, except in the case of
operations that are declared to be ``Infix'' -- MathSpad will (in some cases incorrectly) assume
these are associative.

sequences in Z  prefix of sequences is set inclusion indeed. 
8fPJN2A028bO1AN0E1Sequences8bNKN0E2seqThe type of sequences is formed with the prefix operator 8fPIN2A048bOKN0E1seq. The template has an alternative for

8fPJN2A0/8bO1HN0E1Sequence formers8bNON0E2seqformSequence displays are created with angular brackets in Z. Using the comma operator (see section
8fPIN2A0>8bOMN0E1comma) you can create a sequence of multiple elements. The template for this has one alternative
version, for generating the empty sequence.

might have been an identifier only.)
8fPJN2A028bO1NN0E1Let, lambda, mu, where8bNKN0E2letThis template generates 8fPIN2A098bOKN0E1let, 3bL- and 3bM-expressions. The 3bM expression's second argument is
optional, so there are two versions for that. A final version generates a 8fPIN2A098bOMN0E1where-expression which
interchanges the two placeholders (so the meaning coincides with that of the 8fPIN2A098bOKN0E1let-expression).
8fPJN2A028bO1PN0E1Various operator symbols8bNLN0E2operAll operators in MathSpad have precedences set for them. It is normal for prefix and postfix
operators to have a very high precedence, and so they do on the oz stencil. The infix operators listed
in 8fPIN2A0=8bOPN0E1Spivey89 have the priority listed there plus six. (MathSpad precedences go from 1 up to 20, a

be done more easily. In any other language, this template would be useful for doing (multiple)

which only deals with integers. For convenience I have also added the traditional / notation to this

8fPJN2A028bO1GN0E1Named functions8bNNN0E2prefixSome functions in Z are predefined and have their own macros in 8fPIN2A048bONN0E1oz.sty.  Nothing special can be
said about most of them -- they look like their names in MathSpad and in generated output. Infix
named operators have a priority below all other infix operators in the stencil.
