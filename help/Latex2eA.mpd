There are three different types of boxes.

is used to generate a black rectangle. If this  rectangle has zero width then it is
invisible in the output and is called a strut.
A strut can be used, for example, to increase the vertical space around some
text or expression, or the space between two lines of output. Although
a strut can be made with template 8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1black, template 8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1Strut
in section 8fPIN2A0>8bO1EN0E1Miscellaneous has been written specially for this purpose.

The second type of box is used to hold a short piece of text. 
There are two templates available, namely, 8fPIN2A0<8bOPN0E1BoxMandF and RaiseBox.
The former is used to generate a box or a framed box of text and the latter
to generate a raised or lowered box of text. (In addition template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1GN0E1UnbreakableText
in section 8fPIN2A0>8bO1EN0E1Miscelleneous generates an unframed box of text.)

The third type of box can be used to hold several lines of text. This type of box
is generated by template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1GN0E1MiniPage-ParBox.

Each box is described with four lengths one of which is its width. 
A box has a reference point on its left edge and the distance above that to the top of the box
is called the  height  of the box and from the reference point to the bottom of the box is
called the depth of the box. The sum of the height and the depth of the box
is called the total height of the box. Values must be set for some of these lengths
in a few of the templates.

Finally, there is a template, 8fPIN2A0<8bOON0E1SaveBox,
with which it is possible to give a name to a box and to save it contents. Then 
these contents can be inserted  at  subsequent places in the document simply by
calling up the box.

The text entered into the place holder labelled ``text'' in
each of these versions is treated as a single boxed object. 8fPHN2A09 will not end a line or a
page within it. Thus only short texts may be inserted into this place holder. For
longer texts use template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1GN0E1MiniPage-ParBox. The contents
will be set in the same font as that used for the surrounding text 
unless font instructions are also inserted into the place
holder. The ``Framed Box'' versions of this template will, in addition, put a frame around
the contents.

It is possible to specify the width of the box and where the text should be  positioned in the
box. The latter is indicated by an ``l'' for at the left,  an ``r'' for at the right and a ``c'' if it should
be centred. If an ``s'' is entered, the   inter-word spaces in the text will be stretched or 
compressed so that the text fills the box completely.

The length commands from template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1EN0E1BoxDimensions can  be used in the place holder which
specifies the width of the box.

Use the ``enter'' versions to fill the two extra place holders and then change the version to
a ``hide'' one to improve the appearance  of the  document on the screen.

Neither this  nor template 8fPIN2A0<8bOON0E1SaveBox should be used when making pictures.  Similar but
different templates are available in the group of templates labelled 8fPIN2A0>8bOPN0E1Pictures
and these must be used in picture environments.

This template causes a piece of text to be entered into  either a 8fPHN2A09 mini page  
environment or into the text argument of a parbox command. This is then  considered to
be a single item when  the output is being generated.

The mini-page environment and parbox are very similar. However if the text to be
inserted contains  a tabbing or  a list  environment then  you must use  the mini-page
versions.

The primary  place holder is the place holder for the text. 
The  second place holder is for the width of the
minipage or parbox and the third place holder indicates how  it is to be aligned  with the
rest of the current line of output. Three possibilities are available, namely ``t'',
 ``c'' or ``b''. If ``t'' is
entered into this place holder then the top line of the mini page or parbox is to be aligned
with the line of output. A ``b'' indicates that the bottom line  of the mini page or parbox is to
be aligned with the line of output and a ``c'' indicates that the  centre  of the mini page or
parbox should be lined up with the line of output.

The ``hide'' versions of this template conceal all but the contents of the place holder for the
text. Thus, use an ``enter'' version to fill the place holders and then change the version to a
``hide'' one to improve the appearance  of the  document on the screen. 

The screen version of this template does not correspond with the 8fPHN2A09 output.

This template can be used to raise or lower a piece of text. The
text is considered to be a single boxed object by 8fPHN2A09 and no line or page breaks will
occur within it. The first four versions of the template contain two place holders, one for
the text and one with which to specify by how much the text should be raised or lowered
relative to the current line of output.

It is also possible to specify the size of a larger box than is necessary to hold the text. Use one
of the two versions labelled ``8fPIN2A0<8bO1HN0E1-options (enter)'' to do this. There are four place holders to
be filled in. Two are for the text and the distance to raise or lower it as before.   Enter into
the remaining two place holders how far you wish the box  containing the text to extend
above the baseline (height) and how far it should descend below the baseline (depth). The
sum of these two is the total height of the box required. Once the information has been
entered, switch to a ``8fPIN2A0<8bO1GN0E1-options (hide)'' version to improve the appearance of the
document on the screen.

If there is a piece of text which is repeated several times in the
document it may be advantageous to  save it  in a named box and call the box wherever it
is needed. The contents of the box are only processed once by 8fPHN2A09 and it may also save
on typing. However as the contents of the box will not be split across lines or pages  it must
be a short piece of text.

Firstly, create a new save box with the first version of this template. Insert  a name into the
place holder. This should be a string of letters and should not be the name of an existing
command. Uppercase letters are considered to be different from lower case letters. 

Secondly, select one of the ``8fPIN2A0<8bONN0E1Define'' versions  and enter the text to be saved and the name
of the box into the place holders. There is one version where the size of the box will exactly
fit the contents and two versions where you can specify the width of the box. If the latter is
required use the 8fPIN2A0<8bOON0E1(enter) version to fill the additional place holders and then if you want
to, switch to the 8fPIN2A0<8bONN0E1(hide) version to improve the appearance of the document on the screen.
In addition to the place holder for the width there is one with which to specify how the text
should be positioned within the box. This should be set to  either ``l'' for at the left,  ``r'' for at
the right, ``c'' for centred and ``s'' if the inter-word spaces in the text should be stretched
or  compressed so that the text fills the box completely. 

Neither this  nor template 8fPIN2A0<8bOPN0E1BoxMandF should be used when making pictures.   Similar but
different templates are available in the group of templates labelled 8fPIN2A0>8bOPN0E1Pictures and these
must be used in picture environments.

The width of the line framing, and the separation between this line and the contents
of a framed box are determined by the value of  parameters
8fPIN2A0B8bOPN0E1fboxrule and 8fPIN2A0B8bOON0E1fboxsep respectively. These are stored as versions of template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1EN0E1BoxParameters.  
The default values assigned to
them can be altered by the user as follows.  First insert into the document  a version of 
template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1HN0E1Parameters-OpsOn and insert into the principal  place holder the name of the
parameter to be changed from template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1EN0E1BoxParameters.  Finally insert the new value or
the change to the value required in the other place holder. 

Note that these parameters do not effect the boxes used in pictures.

There are several defined by 8fPHN2A09. These are used to keep
a count of, among other things, the sectional units and the number of the page.

The counter templates have been written so that they can be used with
templates provided for the 8fPIN2A0B8bONN0E1ifthen package. Consequently if you need to use a 
unary minus applied to the value of another counter in, for example, 
the 8fPIN2A0<8bONN0E1SetCtr version of template 8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1OpsOn,
then you should use the operator provided for the 8fPIN2A0B8bONN0E1ifthen package.
I don't think you should need any other mathematical operators within
place holders of counter templates but if you do, use the
ones provided for the 8fPIN2A0B8bONN0E1ifthen package.

Operations on user-defined and 8fPHN2A09 counters can be accomplished

The commands in template 8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1OpsOn can be used on both user-defined counters and
8fPHN2A09 counters. However it is recommended that version 8fPIN2A0<8bO2BN0E1PrintValue in defaultstyle is  only used
with user-defined counters. The commands available are as follows:

8fPIN2A0F8bOON0E18fPJN2A0E8bO19GN0E1This command is used to give a value to an existing counter. Insert the
name of the counter in the first place holder and the value into the
second.  Arithmetic expressions are not allowed in the ``value'' place holder.  The
only exception is a negated value. Constants, such as 8fPJN0A08ePHN2B0ISe1b8d40I!  !1CC-GVe1b8d41G!"CC-8E8fPIN0A05, can be entered directly;
to enter any other negated value  you should  use
the  template supplied with the 8fPIN2A0B8bONN0E1ifthen package.8bNNN0E2SetCtr8fPJN2A0E8bO9CN0E1This is similar to 8fPIN2A0<8bONN0E1SetCtr except that  the value in the  second place holder is
added to the value in the counter.  The same restrictions apply.8bNPN0E2AddToCtr8fPJN2A0E8bO30AN0E1Output the value stored in the counter usually directly into the
document but possibly into a definition of a command. To print the  value
of one of the standard  8fPHN2A09 counters either enter the name of the
counter from the keyboard or use  template  8fPIN2A0<8bO2CN0E1PrintLaTeXCtr(DefaultStyle).
Unfortunately entering the name by means of template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1AN0E1LaTeXCtrs
into this particular version will cause an error. (The names of 8fPHN2A09
counters can be entered into the other versions of this template and into
versions of template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1NN0E1PrintCtr(SpecifyStyle) with the aid of template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1AN0E1LaTeXCtrs
without causing any problems.)

A counter created by the user will, by default, be printed
in Arabic numerals. If another style is required either alter the style
with template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1LN0E1SetDefaultPrintStyle and then use this version or, alternatively,
use the appropriate version of template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1NN0E1PrintCtr(SpecifyStyle).8bN2CN0E2PrintValue in default style8fPJN2A0E8bO7FN0E1This generates the value stored in the counter and is used in place
holders of other commands such as 8fPIN2A0<8bONN0E1SetCtr and 8fPIN2A0<8bOPN0E1AddToCtr.8bN1CN0E2UseValueCtr8fPJN2A0E8bO17MN0E1Add one to the value stored in the counter whose name has been
inserted into the place holder of this command. Additionally,  any
counters numbered 8fPIN2A0D8bO1AN0E1within it are reset to zero. For example, suppose 
subsection 3 of section 2  is labelled with 2.3. That is, subsections are
labelled 8fPIN2A0D8bONN0E1within sections. Then every time that the  section counter is
8fPIN2A0D8bOON0E1stepped the subsection counter is reset to zero.8bN1CN0E2StepCounter8fPJN2A0E8bOaGN0E1This is the same as 8fPIN2A0<8bO1CN0E1StepCounter except that it also resets the

The usual way to print the
value of a counter is to select version 8fPIN2A0<8bO1BN0E1PrintValue from template 8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1OpsOn and enter the
name of the  counter into the place holder. If this is one of the 8fPHN2A09 counters stored as a
version of template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1AN0E1LaTeXCtrs do not enter the name of the counter
into the place holder by clicking on the appropriate version of template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1AN0E1LaTeXCtrs.
This unfortunately will cause an error. Either enter the name of the 8fPHN2A09 counter

This group of templates  enables the user to define his or her own commands, environments and
theorem-like structures. The first of these is often used for saving a complicated piece of
 text which occurs several times in the document. Calling the command
instead of entering the text each time reduces the typing required but does not
reduce the time spent processing the document as 8fPHN2A09 process the text in the command
each time the command appears in the document.

The 8fPIN2A0<8bO1FN0E1NewEnvironment template enables the user to specify the layout of structures in the
document.

Finally the 8fPIN2A0<8bO1BN0E1NewTheorem template can be used to define 
theorem-like structures such as lemmas and corollaries.

As the 8fPIN2A0>8bONN0E1return key is treated by 8fPHN2A09 as if it were a space character it is usual
when writing a definition to insert a 8fPHN2A0Y character before pressing 8fPIN2A0>8bONN0E1return on the
keyboard in order to to avoid adding unwanted space into the definition.  (8fPHN2A09 will
ignore the 8fPHN2A0Y character and all following characters up to and including the carriage
return symbol. Any ordinary space at the start of the following line will also be ignored.)

There are 9 versions of this template. There are 3 starting with ``8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1New 8fPHN2A0Q'', 3 starting with
``8fPIN2A0<8bOON0E1Renew 8fPHN2A0Q'' and 3 with ``8fPIN2A0<8bO1AN0E1Provide 8fPHN2A0Q''. Each set of 3 has a similar format. 

The ``8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1New 8fPHN2A0Q'' versions are used to define new commands and the ``8fPIN2A0<8bOON0E1Renew 8fPHN2A0Q'' ones to
change the definition of an existing command.  

If a ``8fPIN2A0<8bO1AN0E1Provide 8fPHN2A0Q'' version is entered into the document then it is
only used if there is not an existing command of that name. In that case it is as if a
``8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1New 8fPHN2A0Q'' version has been entered into the document. If there is already a command with
the name then the existing definition of the command is not altered.

Each of the 9 versions has a place holder for the name of the command and one for the
definition. The name must begin with a backslash, ``8fPHN2A0T'', and be  followed either by a string of
letters or a single non-letter character. For the ``8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1New 8fPHN2A0Q'' versions it must be a new
name and for the ``8fPIN2A0<8bOON0E1Renew 8fPHN2A0Q'' versions it must be the name of an existing command.  

A command may have up to and including 9 arguments. If the command has arguments
then these are denoted in the definition by the number of the argument preceded by the
hash symbol (``8fPHN2A0[''). Thus for example, the second argument of a command having at least
2 arguments is denoted by ``8fPHN2A0[2'' in the definition.  

If the definition consists of mathematics and the command may be used both in text and
mathematics then it must be entered into the definition in a special way. This is because if
it is used in text the definition must begin with a change of mode from text to math.
However if it is used in mathematics then this change of mode instruction at the start of
the definition would change the mode from math to text when you in fact
wish the mode to remain as math mode. This problem can be overcome
with the use of template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1BN0E1EnsureMath. First enter this
template  into the definition and then the mathematics into its place holder.
 
Finally it is possible to define commands with an optional first argument.
If such a version of the template is selected then the default value of this argument
must be entered into the place holder provided.

As the 8fPIN2A0>8bONN0E1return key is treated by 8fPHN2A09 as if it were a space character it is usual
when writing a definition to insert a 8fPHN2A0Y character before pressing 8fPIN2A0>8bONN0E1return on the
keyboard in order to to avoid adding unwanted space into the definition.  (8fPHN2A09 will
ignore the 8fPHN2A0Y character and all following characters up to and including the carriage
return symbol. Any ordinary space at the start of the following line will also be ignored.)

There are 6 versions of this template. The names of three of them start with ``8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1New 8fPHN2A0Q'' 
and  3 start with ``8fPIN2A0<8bOON0E1Renew 8fPHN2A0Q''. Each set of 3 has a similar format. The ``8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1New 8fPHN2A0Q'' versions
are used to define new environments and the ``8fPIN2A0<8bOON0E1Renew 8fPHN2A0Q'' ones to change the definition of
an existing environment.

Each of the 6 versions has one place holder for the name of the environment and two for
the definition of the environment. The name can be any string of letters, numbers and the
symbol ``*'' which doesn't start with the sequence 8fPIN2A0;8bOKN0E1end. For the ``8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1New 8fPHN2A0Q'' versions it
must be a new name. (In addition the name preceded by a backslash (``8fPHN2A0T'') must not be the name of an
existing command.) For the ``8fPIN2A0<8bOON0E1Renew 8fPHN2A0Q'' versions the name  must be the name of an
existing environment. 

An environment may have up to and including 9 arguments. If the environment has
arguments then these are denoted in the definition by the number of the argument
preceded by the hash symbol (``8fPHN2A0[''). Thus for example, the second argument of an
environment having at least 2 arguments is denoted by ``8fPHN2A0[2'' in the definition.  

It is possible to define environments with an optional first argument.
If such a version of the template is selected then the default value of this argument
must be entered into the place holder provided.

The remaining two place holders are used to contain the definition of the environment.
The contents of the first place holder are executed when entering the environment and
the contents of the second place holder are executed on leaving the environment. These
place holders will normally contain some raw 8fPHN2A09 commands 
and possibly some 8fPHN2A0  templates as well. Arguments of the environment
may only occur in the first of the two place holders. We suggest
you consult the 8fPHN2A09 manual if you need help filling these two place holders.

To avoid adding any unwanted extra space into a definition when ending a line of code
always insert the 8fPHN2A0Y symbol first and then press the return key on the keyboard.

This template can be used to define theorem-like structures. There are three
versions the only difference between them being how the new
structure is to be numbered.

The first place holder of each version is for the name of the structure. This may be any
string of letters which is not the name of an existing environment or counter. 

The second place holder is for the text which is to label this structure in the printed output.
This could well be the same as the contents of the first place holder.

The differences in the numbering system for the three versions 
is described below:

of this new theorem-like structure in the printed output.
Enter into the place holder the name of the required counter. This could, for
example be ``chapter'', then the first occurrence of the structure in chapter one
would be numbered 1.1, that in chapter two would be numbered 2.1 and so on. (Of
course you can alter the printing format of the counters

these can be called by inserting a version of template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1BN0E1UseCommand into the document.
Only versions have been provided for commands with up to and including

If the version you need is not available then you should add one yourself
using the other versions as a guide.

Each version has a place holder for the name of the command. Don't forget
that the first character of the name is always a backslash, ``8fPHN2A0T''.

Chose a version with the correct number of arguments.

A  user can  define his or her own theorem-like structures with template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1BN0E1NewTheorem.  
Subsequently these can be called by inserting a version of template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1BN0E1UseTheorem into the 
document.


Some of the versions of the template include a place holder for a label. These enable
the user to refer to a particular occurrence of the theorem-like structure
without knowing how it will be numbered  in the
8fPHN2A09 output.  Suppose that a structure was inserted into a document with a version
which has a place holder for a label and suppose that the label entered was
``8fPIN2A0<8bO1EN0E1SmithsTheorem''. Then to refer to this theorem at other places in the document  select
either version 8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1(Ref) or 8fPIN2A0<8bOKN0E1Ref from template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1GN0E1Ref(within doc) and insert 8fPIN2A0<8bO1EN0E1SmithsTheorem
into its place holder. Note that the  8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1(Ref) and  8fPIN2A0<8bOKN0E1Ref versions only print the number of
the structure and if any text such as ``theorem'' is required then it  must be inserted  by the
user.  Note also that two consecutive runs of 8fPHN2A09 on the document may be required in
order that such references  within the document are output correctly.  

There are also version which have a place holder for an optional argument.
The contents of this place holder appear in bold type within parentheses following
the name and number of the structure in the final output.
It's often used to assign a name to the structure.

This template is used in combination with template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1BN0E1NewCommand. If the definition of the
command consists of mathematics and the command may be used both in text and
mathematics then it must be entered into the definition in a special way. This is because if
it is used in text the definition must begin with a change of mode from text to math.
However if it is used in mathematics then this change of mode instruction at the start of
the definition would change the mode from math to text when you in fact wish the mode
to remain as math mode. This problem can be overcome with the use of this template.
First enter  template  8fPIN2A0<8bO1CN0E1EnsureMath into the definition and then the mathematics into its
place holder.

It is a good idea to make large items which can not be split across pages, such as a tabular
item, into a floating object to avoid under-filled pages. Two types of floats are available
--- figures and tables. They are placed either at the place where they occur in the
document, at the top of a page, at the bottom of a page or on a separate page (called a 8fPIN2A0D8bO1CN0E1float
page) containing only floating objects.

The template for each type of float has  two sorts of versions. Ones with an asterisk(*) in
the name and ones without. In a document which is to be set with just one column of text
to a page there is no difference between similar versions wherein one is labelled with an
asterisk and the other not. However if the document is to be set  with two columns of text
to a page then the starred versions (8fPIN2A0<8bOON0E1figure* and 8fPIN2A0<8bONN0E1table*) produce a float which extends
over both columns whereas the versions without stars (8fPIN2A0<8bONN0E1figure and 8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1table) produce a float
which is the width of just one column.

Figures and tables are numbered separately.

The content of the principal place holder of the 8fPIN2A0<8bONN0E1Figure or 8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1Table templates is described in
the Figure and Table sections which follow. The other place holders to be filled,  at most 
four depending on the version of the 8fPIN2A0<8bONN0E1Figure or 8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1Table template selected, are described
here as they are the same for both templates.

8fPIN2A0F8bOMN0E18fPJN2A0E8bO52DN0E1This place holder is used to indicate the preference of the user for where the
float should be positioned. One or more of ``h'', ``t'', ``b'', ``p'' or ``!'' should be entered. 
8fPIN2A0F8bOMN0E18fPJN2A0E8bO5AN0E1Position the float at the place at which it appears in the document file.8bNIN0E2h8fPJN2A0E8bO2PN0E1Position the float at the top of a page.8bNIN0E2t8fPJN2A0E8bO3CN0E1Position the float at the bottom of a page.8bNIN0E2b8fPJN2A0E8bO6CN0E1Position the float on a page containing only tables and figures. Such a page is
called a 8fPIN2A0D8bO1BN0E1float page.8bNIN0E2p8fPJN2A0E8bObBN0E18fPHN2A09 is allowed to ignore some formatting parameters, such as the
maximum number of floats allowed at the top of a page, in order to position
the float at an earlier place. 8bNIN0E2! 
The default is ``tbp''. Note that the order of the letters is not significant. ``tbp'' is the
same as ``ptb''. 8fPHN2A09  tries to position the float according to a set of rules in
combination with either the contents of this place holder or its default value ``tbp''.
These rules can be found on page 198 of the 8fPHN2A09 manual or page 145 in the
8fPHN2A09 Companion.

Sometimes floats are not positioned in the output as you would like
them to be. If one appears too early then it may be solved by moving the float to a
later place  in the 8fPIN2A0;8bOKN0E1mpd file or by inserting a version of template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1FN0E1SuppressFloats.
This can be used to prevent  any more floats appearing either at the top, bottom or
both of a particular  page.  If the float appears too late then try inserting ``!'' into the
place holder. Alternatively you could try altering the value of one of the page
parameters effecting the positioning of floats. These parameters can be found in
template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1GN0E1FloatParameters and altered with template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1HN0E1Parameters-OpsOn. Note
that a change to a parameter will not effect the current page but
only subsequent pages. 

For a more detailed description of the problems of placing floats see the 8fPHN2A09
Companion.8bNMN0E2Place8fPJN2A0E8bO31FN0E1Some of the versions of the template include a place holder for a label. These
enable the user to refer to a particular float without knowing how it will be
numbered  in the 8fPHN2A09 output.  Suppose that a figure was inserted into a
document with a version which has a place holder for a label and suppose that the
label entered was ``8fPIN2A0<8bO1CN0E1GraphGrowth''. Then to refer to this figure at other places in
the document  select either version 8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1(Ref) or 8fPIN2A0<8bOKN0E1Ref from template  8fPIN2A0<8bO1GN0E1Ref(within
doc) and insert 8fPIN2A0<8bO1CN0E1GraphGrowth into its place holder. Note that the  8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1(Ref) and 
8fPIN2A0<8bOKN0E1Ref versions only print the number of the figure and if any text such as ``figure''
is required then it  must be inserted  by the user.

others have 8fPIN2A0<8bONN0E1figure. There is no difference between two versions which have similar names,
except one contains an asterisk and the other does not, when used in a document which is to 
be set with just one column of text to a page. However if the document is to be
set  with two columns of text to a page then 8fPIN2A0<8bOON0E1figure* will produce a float which extends 
over both columns whereas 8fPIN2A0<8bONN0E1figure will produce a float which is the width of just one column.

With each  version of this template  the content of the figure is entered into the place
holder labelled ``figure''. This can be something generated by the 8fPHN2A09 picture
environment or another program.  Alternatively you may wish to  output some white
space on which to draw or glue something yourself later. In the latter case use version

If a list of figures has been requested and the contents of the caption
place holder is not a suitable entry then choose a version of the templates
with ``8fPIN2A0<8bOPN0E1capt+LOF'' in its name. This will have a place holder for the ``List of figures

This template has many versions. With each, the contents of the table are entered into the
place holder labelled ``table''. This is usually information displayed in a tabular format. 
For a complicated layout it may be easiest to enter raw 8fPHN2A09 directly into the place
holder. For a more straightforward layout use templates 8fPIN2A0<8bO1EN0E1Tabular-Enter  and
8fPIN2A0<8bO1CN0E1Tabular-row  or create your own templates to do this.

If a list of tables has been requested and the contents of the caption place holder is not a

A version of this template can be inserted into the document to prevent any more floats
being placed on the current page of output. There are versions stopping any more floats
being placed at the top of the page, at the bottom of the page or at both the top and the bottom
of the page.

If a ``!'' has been inserted into the ``Place'' place holder of a float then the 8fPIN2A0<8bO1FN0E1SuppressFloats
command is ignored while positioning that particular float.

Several constraints on the positioning of floats, such as the number of floats allowed at the
top and bottom of a page, are determined by the value of various parameters.   Many of
these parameters are stored as versions of template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1GN0E1FloatParameters.  The default values assigned to
them can be altered by the user as follows.  First insert into the document  a version of 
template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1HN0E1Parameters-OpsOn and insert into the principal  place holder the name of the
parameter to be changed from template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1GN0E1FloatParameters.  Finally insert the new value or
the change to the value required in the other place holder.  

 The float parameters are either  lengths, integers or decimal numbers. The parameters
which specify fractions of a page are decimal numbers and new values must be assigned to
them with the   8fPIN2A0<8bO1CN0E1ChangeValue command. Use either versions 8fPIN2A0<8bO1CN0E1Set counter or 8fPIN2A0<8bO1FN0E1Add to
counter to change a parameter which has an integer value. 

Finally use either  8fPIN2A0<8bO1BN0E1Set length or 8fPIN2A0<8bO1EN0E1Add to length to assign a new value to one of the length
parameters. Those  in template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1GN0E1FloatParameters are rubber lengths. That is, they are
allowed to vary slightly. A change to a rubber length should leave it as a stretchable length.  
Remember also when dealing with lengths to specify the units. This may be 8fPIN2A0<8bOJN0E1cm, 8fPIN2A0<8bOJN0E1mm, 8fPIN2A0<8bOJN0E1in,

This template has 4 versions ---8fPIN2A0<8bO1DN0E1displaystyle, 8fPIN2A0<8bO1AN0E1textstyle, 8fPIN2A0<8bO1DN0E1script style and 8fPIN2A0<8bO1JN0E1scriptscript
style.  All four versions are used to override the default style.
Displaystyle is the default style for displayed mathematics, and textstyle the default
for mathematics occurring in running text.  Script style is the default for sub or superscripts, and
scriptscript style for all further levels of sub or superscripting.

The first version may be used, for example, when it is desired to use displaystyle in running 
text and the second version when it is desired to use 
textstyle in displayed mathematics.  The effect of these two versions is, however,  confined to the 
14 symbols shown in the table below. For other symbols there is no difference between
the display and text styles. These 14  symbols are available as versions of template

This template has two versions. If the first of these, 8fPIN2A0<8bO1EN0E1Maths in bold is inserted into the 
document then subsequently everything in a mathematics environment, (symbols as
well as letters), will be set in a bold type face. Do not enter this template into a mathematical
environment but into the normal text before the mathematics that you wish to be in bold. To
revert to the default  insert the version 8fPIN2A0<8bO1IN0E1Maths not in bold into the document, again not
within a mathematical environment. If you wish to set part of a line of mathematics in
a bold font then enter a version of template 8fPIN2A0<8bOPN0E1BoxMandF at the appropriate point in the
line and enter into it version 8fPIN2A0<8bO1EN0E1Maths in bold followed by a place holder for an
expression. Enter into this place holder the mathematics to be set in bold. It is not
necessary to enter the 8fPIN2A0<8bO1IN0E1Maths not in bold version as a final entry into the 
version of template 8fPIN2A0<8bOPN0E1BoxMandF.

Using the 8fPIN2A0<8bO1EN0E1Maths in bold version may cause 8fPHN2A09 to output a warning message
that a font is missing. This may be one that you don't need but the output should in any
case be checked.

 In 8fPHN2A07 fonts  are grouped into families.  The members of a family
are similar in their appearance. There are three standard families available with
8fPHN2A07  ---  roman, 8fPIN2A0<8bO1BN0E1sans serif and 8fPIN2A0;8bO1BN0E1typewriter. Within each family there can be
different shapes of fonts. The ones available with 8fPHN2A07 are 8fPIN2A0C8bOON0E1upright, 8fPIN2A0B8bONN0E1italic, 8fPIN2A0A8bOON0E1slanted
and S8fPIN2A0N8bOLN0E1MALLC8fPIN2A0N8bOON0E1APITALS. Finally there may be fonts from the same family with the same
shape but which have different  thicknesses called series in the 8fPHN2A09 manual. There
are two available --- medium and 8fPIN2A0>8bOLN0E1bold. Thus with 8fPHN2A07 a font is specified by its
family, shape and series. Not all shapes, series and sizes of fonts  may be available  in a
family. If a requested font is not available 8fPHN2A07 will substitute another and send a
warning message to the console and to the 8fPIN2A0;8bOKN0E1log file.
