Plain (non-mathematical) text can be edited with a number of keyboard  commands. The
commands are based on those provided by Emacs  and most of the  usual functions are
available. Some commands, however, behave slightly differently from those of most text
editors, because of the possibility to use proportional fonts and because of the way the
target selection is handled.

purposes of text editing, is  treated as if it were a  single  symbol. Moving the cursor
character by character through the document will display such a group in inverse video
mode as if it were a target selection. For example, move the cursor one character at a time
along the sentence ``In 8fPHN2A0ISafa0e17G   !0GVafa0e17F#!MC80JbfIMath222LpaddfILC80J\mplogo{}?, there are three types of selection.''  (Use 8fPIN2A068bOKN0E1C-F or the
right arrow key on your keyboard.) You will see that when the cursor reaches
8fPHN2A0?, the complete word ``8fPHN2A0?'' is displayed in inverse video mode. Move
one more symbol to the right and the cursor will be between 8fPHN2A0?  and the comma.
This is because 8fPHN2A0?  was input with a template and is treated as a single
character at the text level.  

The effect of some operations depends on whether or not the target is set.  It is
important to remember that the cursor  is considered to be indicating the position
of an 8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1empty target.  

With 8fPHN2A0? it is very easy to insert special characters  into  the  text.  These
symbols are selected from a symbol palette and are then  handled like normal
characters in the editing actions as far as the screen version is concerned.

argument is 1 but  may  be changed with the 8fPIN2A068bOKN0E1C-U key.  To set the argument,
input  8fPIN2A068bOKN0E1C-U  followed by a non-negative number (the required number of 
repeats).  At this stage the instruction  can be aborted  without specifying  a

with this command ensure that the cursor is where you require
it. 

The query replace will ask for two strings, the  string  to be
sought  and the replacement string.  Both strings must be of the
same   type  and there are two types possible. The first type is a
sequence of characters or symbols input from the keyboard or a
symbol palette and terminated with a 8fPIN2A068bONN0E1return. The second type is a
template input from a stencil  palette. Thus a string consisting of
a mixture of templates and other symbols is not allowed.

After the two strings have been entered 8fPHN2A0? will search
for occurrences of the search string within the scope   of the
query-replace  command. The scope is  either the source
selection if  this  is set and is visible in the window or it is  the
portion  of the document stretching from the target or
cursor up to the end of the document. If an occurrence of the
search string is found the user is asked to respond with one of the

Furthermore, some keys receive special treatment when they are used
in expressions. 

The 8fPIN2A068bOMN0E1space character can not be inserted into an expression or identifier and
when this is tried, the editor will move the selection to the next empty place
holder or text position, which ever comes first. If a text position is found, the
space will be inserted at that position. Otherwise the space will not be inserted.
For example, when an identifier8fPON2A0=8bIHN0E78bJHN0E68bKHN0E58bLHN0E48bMHN0E38bN1CN0E2terminating8bO1DN0E1place holder is used in a text and the name is filled in, the
name can be ended with a space character which will be inserted immediately
after the identifier in the text. However, when the identifier is part of a larger
expression with empty place holders after the identifier then the selection will
move to the first empty place holder after the identifier. 

The 8fPIN2A068bOPN0E1C-return key is similar except  a  return is entered in the text instead
of a space. The 8fPIN2A068bONN0E1return key can also be used to terminate an expression or
identifier but in this case neither a return nor a space is entered into the text.

The ``8fPIN2A068bOIN0E1('' key will place parentheses around an expression or insert it in an identifier.
The ``8fPIN2A068bOIN0E1)'' key will insert a parenthesis in an identifier if the matching opening brace is in
that identifier. Otherwise the smallest parenthesised expression is selected. The
combination of those two keys makes it possible to insert an expression from left
to right.

The 8fPIN2A068bOIN0E1, key will insert a comma after the identifier and insert a new identifier or
expression after the comma. If it is not possible to do this, the comma will be
inserted in the identifier.

placing information from a 8fPHN2A0? document into the window port.  Text 
transported from a 8fPHN2A0? document to the window system via this port is
first translated to 8fPHN2A0D to ensure that it is accepted by other  programs. For
normal text, there will be no difference between the 8fPHN2A0D code and the ascii

headings, for indexing, for footnotes, for quotations and so on.  They are
particularly useful as a mechanism to save you the chore of  repeatedly entering
the same information (with the attendant risk of error).  For instance, you may
wish to construct an ``address'' template containing versions for your postal
address, your email address and your personal world-wide web URL.  A single
click is then sufficient to enter the information into a document.  (If you exploit
this possibility take care to get the information in the template definition  exactly
right. Computers do not 8fPIN2A0<8bO1AN0E1eliminate error:  the advantage of using them is that,
unlike human beings, they do not 8fPIN2A0<8bO1AN0E1introduce error.  Their disadvantage is that
any errors we introduce are faithfully reproduced, and potentially at a very high
rate!) 

To change the font (say) of text that has already been
entered it suffices to set the target to the text to be printed in a different font and
then click on the appropriate version in the 8fPIN2A048bO1AN0E1TextStyle template in the 8fPIN2A068bOON0E1latex2e stencil.

In general, if a template with one or more text place holders is used when a
target selection has been set, the selected text will be inserted at the first
available text place holder in the template. 

Information within a text place holder can be edited like  normal text and can
contain the same items as  normal text. Thus  a text place holder may contain,
for example, expressions  and special symbols. To insert information in a text 
place holder, click on the place holder and  and then proceed as usual.  

Inside a  tabbing environment  8fPHN2A0D's automatic  line breaking routines  are
disabled.  Therefore when filling a text place holder in a tabbing  environment
the user should  insert line breaks at the appropriate places. The
proportionally-spaced font  used in the screen version of the document is a help
in this situation.
