Engineering design is about creating artefacts that fulfil a  need to the best of the ability
of current technology.   Good design involves insightful decisions on what is important,
and what should be given priority. 

The 8fPIN2A0=8bOLN0E1need that 8fPHN2A0+ attempts to fulfil is the ability to write mathematical
documents, of publication quality, ergonomically.  8fPHN2A0+ builds on the 8fPHN2A0ISe1cfa44M   %2GCLaTeX1CCLatex2e#LaTeXHelpGVe1cfa44N#!1FCLccA81JA81L 81M81N80PT81K81L81K81L81ME81N81M81NXKC80J\LaTeX{}GVe1cfa44O#!MCT81K81L81K81L81ME81N81M81NXIC80J\TeX{}GVe1cfa45A#!1HCLccA81JA81L 81M81N80PT81K81L81K81L81ME81N81M81NX23bF4AC80J{\mathsurround=0pt\LaTeX $2_80L{\textstyle 3bF}$\hspace{-0.4mm}}{}GVe1cfa45B#!1BCBccAIB80PT81K81L81K81L81ME81N81M81NX1FC80J80J\textsc{Bib}\TeX{}GVe1e4779B#!MCbfMMakeIndexdfMOCbfMMakeIndexdfM{}A and

8fPHN2A0B are  both ``wonderful'' and ``awful'' and their users are ``masochists''.  Thirty
years from now noone will be writing mathematics using 8fPHN2A0B or indeed any
ascii-based markup language.  Let's hope however that  that situation arrives a bit
sooner than after thirty years.

Why do scientists feel the need to write publication-quality documents?  After all, in
bygone days, getting a document to publication standard was the task of a professional
copy-editor.  The scientist's responsibility was getting the content right.

One answer to this question is the desire of all scientists to communicate the results of
their effort in the best possible light.  Such a desire we can all appreciate, but this is not
the right answer.  The overwhelming consideration for the scientist is the desire to
eliminate the possibility of 8fPIN2A0=8bO1IN0E1introducing error8fPIN2A0ISe1cf70aF   "2JCFootnote1FCLatex2e#FootnoteHelpGVe1cf70aG'!1ACbfMFootnote:dfM {8bO}OC80J\footnote{8bO}1DCFootnote(Editable)GVe1cf70aH#!JCbfK81Jf81L 81M81NdfK1AC80J\footnote{80O8bO}81OH8bO30AN0E1Avoiding the introduction of error as the number one priority can lead scientists to do
rather strange things.  In the seventies, for example, it was quite common for
computing scientists to produce their books on a computer and deliver
``camera-ready'' copy rather than put their trust in a professional printer.   The
results were awful.  It was obvious which books had been produced by computer and
which not, and the former were a real pain to read no matter how good the content! 
(See the frank admission by the author of one such book ---David Gries--- in
8fPJN2A0F8bN1GN0E2see the preface8bOMN0E1GS93a.)  In those days both the reader and the writer were expected to be
``masochists''; at the time that development of 8fPHN2A0+ began it was only the writer.
Our goal was to relieve the writer's misery too..  Accordingly, avoiding the introduction of
error has been the driving force behind all design decisions in the development of 
8fPHN2A0+.

8fPKN2A0*8bMHN@E3"8bO2JN0E1Avoiding the Introduction of Error8bNIN0E28fPHN2A00

Avoiding the 8fPIN2A0=8bO1DN0E1introduction of error is a much more modest aim than the 8fPIN2A0=8bO1CN0E1elimination of
error.  We believe, however, that the former is a realistic aim for a software tool whereas
the latter is not. Recognition of the  difference between these two goals leads to a
fundamental difference in one's approach to tool building.

8fPHN2A0+ was originally developed to support the work of a research group
active in the area of the mathematics of (computer) program construction.  The nature
of the group's work was (and is) such that their articles frequently involve substantial
algebraic calculations in advanced areas of mathematics.  The primary tools used by the
group to  carry out their work were (and still are) paper and pencil.

Performing algebraic calculations at a computer terminal and doing them by  hand
with paper and pencil are quite different sorts of activities.  In designing 8fPHN2A0+
we started out from the viewpoint that the latter (using paper and pencil) is much
more reliable than the former (using a computer).  This is quite contrary to prevailing
claims made about formal verification systems and the  like.  One must recognise,
however, that,  for us as human beings,  paper and  pencil is so much 8fPIN2A0:8bOON0E1handier;  the
computer, in comparison, is a very clumsy instrument, and the use of a clumsy or
badly-designed tool will inevitably  introduce errors of its own kind.  

The traditional argument for the use of a computer for algebraic calculations,  that
computers are able to faithfully execute formal manipulation rules, is one that we find
difficult to justify in the context of our own research.  The  problem is that it is
frequently hard to explain to a dumb machine how a rule  should be applied in a
particular situation because there are ---from the  trained scientist's point of view---
so many trivial intermediate steps that also have to be explained.  The icon that is used
for 8fPHN2A0+ illustrates this point.

In order to see the correspondence between the general property and the two specific
instances one must recognise that the general property has been  expressed in terms of
functions alone, whilst the instances are in terms of  functions applied to their
arguments.  One must also recognise that plus and  times are both 8fPIN2A0=8bONN0E1binary functions
and that this must be taken into account in an  explanation that the identity  8fPIN2A0r8bOIN0E18fPKN0A08fPKN0A08fPIN2A0x8fOKN0A18fPIN0A0x8ePHN2B0}8fPIN0A0y8ePHN2B0k8fPKN0A08fPIN2A0x8fOIN0A1x8ePHN2B07P8fPIN2A0x8fOIN0A1y8ePHN6B0Co8fPKN0A08fPKN0A08fPIN2A0w8fOIN0A1x8ePHN2B0}8fPIN2A0w8fOIN0A1y8ePHN2B0k8fPIN2A0w8fOKN0A18fPIN0A0x8ePHN2B07P8fPIN0A0y
is indeed an instance of the general property.  This can be difficult to explain  to a fellow
human being but it is nothing compared to the overhead that is  typically required in
order to command a computer program to apply the  general rule.  

The working scientist (or engineer) has a need to be able to get on with  productive  work
and requires a tool that will allow him to communicate the  justification for his
calculation steps at the level of formality of his own choosing.  The working scientist is
very conscious of the possibility of error and will choose his tools carefully in order to
avoid the danger of its introduction; the responsibility for 8fPIN2A0=8bO1CN0E1eliminating error, however, 
remains his and is not delegated either to a machine or to a colleague. It is such scientists
that 8fPHN2A0+ aims to cater for. 

8fPKN2A0*8bMHN@E3"8bO1GN0E1Four Priorities8bNIN0E28fPHN2A00 
Having identified the goals of the 8fPHN2A0+ system, we now turn to the priorities we set
in order to achieve those goals.

The first priority  was 8fPIN2A0=8bO1CN0E1readability.     Mathematical notation has been designed over
centuries to be eminently  readable, so a first requirement of the 8fPHN2A0+ system was
that one should be able to work directly with mathematical notation (and not some
approximation to mathematical notation). 

Of course, we can all train ourselves to read the unreadable.  Blind people  learn to read
braille and  are able to cope admirably well.  Those who have been programming for a
quarter of a century or more will remember the time when it was necessary to be able 
to read paper tape in order to amend or correct a program.  It is a skill that is soon
learnt and, after some practice, it is possible to convince oneself that it can be done
without thinking.   To do so is however pure self-deception.  Indeed, it is quite  probably
the case that the use of paper tape as input medium contributed far more in those days
to the unreliability of computer software than did the lack of structured programming 
techniques.

Monospaced text, particularly when used for mathematical work,  is also unreadable,
although it has been around for so long that many ardent computer users do not seem
to realise the training that has to be undergone to learn how to read it.  To illustrate the
point consider the expression 8fPIN2A048bOON0E1a+b.c+d as written here in typewriter font.  The 
justification for the  mathematical convention that multiplication is denoted by the
smallest symbol (a dot) and has the highest precedence is totally negated by the white
space around the symbol  created by the use of a monospaced font.  The eye naturally
groups the expression into the two subexpressions  8fPIN2A048bOKN0E1a+b and 8fPIN2A048bOKN0E1c+d, and the intended
structure of the expression is completely disguised.  In general, the use of a monospaced
font  completely frustrates attempts to impart structure to the reader.   Matters are
made quite intolerable when this is combined with the limitations of the ascii character
set (as happens in programming languages).  It is indeed our contention that the
continuing  use of monospaced ascii as primary input medium to computer programs
is the most significant single source of programming error.   The belief that one can do
creative mathematics in ascii is  as ridiculous as the belief that one can do creative
mathematics in paper tape format.  

Our second priority was 8fPIN2A0=8bO1CN0E1flexibility.    8fPHN2A0+ was designed to support the work of
a  research group engaged in the exploration of novel mathematical theories and so
flexibility was a must.  But flexibility is also vital to all scientists.  Even if one is ---for
example--- designing an algorithm for some well-defined, specialist task it is likely
that one needs to appeal to a whole host of existing mathematical theories.  (It is often
the case that it is only  when one submits one's design to a completely formal proof that
one becomes truly aware of  just how many.)   The use of a system designed to support
only a subset of available  mathematical knowledge will be more effort than it is worth.

Flexibility means that the responsibility for error lies fairly and squarely on the
shoulders of the user.   All formal proof assistants of which we are aware attempt to
relieve the user  of some of this responsibility by restricting the available possibilities. 
One often sees claims like: ``the system guarantees that only type-correct statements
can be entered''.   Our view is that this is a totally misguided policy.   The discipline of
thoroughness must remain an integral part of the scientific ethic and not be imposed by
a machine. We have to throw away the idea of ``expert systems'' intended to replace
the experts and get back to ``systems for experts'', i.e. systems designed to assist experts
in a particular field in  doing their work efficiently and effectively.  

The third priority in the design of 8fPHN2A0+ was to support the 8fPIN2A0=8bOON0E1writing of scientific
articles rather than the production of a finished product.  The papers that we ourselves
write tend to undergo many revisions, often extending over years rather than months.
The drafts we write need to be highly readable but often contain inadequate proofs ---
inadequate because they are too complicated, not at the right level of abstraction, 
incomplete, and sometimes downright wrong.    When the finished product is finally 
ready it is usually the case that we feel a sense of shame at our own stupidity during the
course of its production.  The finished product is intended to show how the ideas should
be  formulated, and how the theorems should be proved, but it is rarely the case that the
 finished product represents how its results were first established.  The time required
for  the production of  the finished product is also relatively short compared to the time
required to reach a  state in which a finished product is conceivable.  

Verification systems seems to assume that their users are as inhuman as the system
itself: always systematic, always tidy and well organised, always precise and always
correct.  (Or, if this is not the case, at least willing to be disciplined by the machine into
such a mode of working.) They are intended to provide the final seal of approval on
work that is already well developed and well organised.  They do have a purpose but, in
our view, a purpose that has been  given an unduly high priority.  A machine-supplied
seal of approval has had no priority in  the development of 8fPHN2A0+. 

The final priority in the design of 8fPHN2A0+  was that mathematics and text should be
completely integrated.   Mathematics is not about mathematical calculations. It is
about the nature of the calculations: what the mathematics is about, why one should be
interested in a particular calculation or theorem, and what one can learn  from it.
Doing mathematics is a literary exercise: a mathematical article is an essay, and a 
mathematics book is a novel complete with a plot and main characters.  (We include in
this writing computer  programs which we also regard as a mathematical exercise.)  
We cannot envisage doing mathematics  without being able to freely intersperse prose
with mathematical calculations.   Computerised math systems rarely cater for this
viewpoint.  It is often physically impossible to include explanatory text and where it is
possible it is often the case that the inclusion of  text is severely restricted.

8fPKN2A0*8bMHN@E3"8bO1FN0E1Software Tools8bNIN0E28fPHN2A00

One final bit of philosophy:  tools are things like hammers and chisels, implements to
assist the craftsman. Software tools may be more complicated to produce; 
nevertheless, their nature is just the same.  They are there to assist.  They are not there to
impose a particular style of working.   We have our own views on the scientific method,
as will be evident from these pages.  You may or may not agree with those views.  But, if
we have done our job right, it shouldn't matter one way or the other.   8fPHN2A0+ is
intended to assist, the way you use it is up to you.
