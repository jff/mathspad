respectively. The
difference between them is how the items  are marked. Each item in a description type list
begins with a label, that in an enumerate type list with a number and that in an itemize
type list with a bullet. An example of each is shown below.

There is a separate template for each type and they are called 8fPIN2A0<8bO1CN0E1Description, 
8fPIN2A0<8bO1AN0E1Enumerate and 8fPIN2A0<8bOON0E1Itemize respectively. The three templates are used in a similar way. First enter 
the list environment into the document by clicking on the  first version of the
template. Its place holder becomes the target selection. Click on the second version
and a template for the first item is inserted into the list. For the enumerate and
itemize commands the version has just one place holder into which the text of the
first item in the list should be entered. The item version of the description environment 
has two  place holders---the left one  for
the label and the  other for the text. 

After the first item in the list has been entered, use  the right arrow on the keyboard   to
move out of the place holder but to remain within the list environment.  If the dots are
shown on the screen the cursor should be just before the last dot. Then click on the 8fPIN2A0<8bOLN0E1Item
version again and a template for the second entry in the list will appear on the screen.
Continue in this manner until the list is complete. To enter an item between two existing
items in the list position the cursor between the two items and select the 8fPIN2A0<8bOLN0E1item version. 

Note that, although numbers mark the entries of an enumerated list in the printed output,
they are  marked on the screen by ``(8fPIN2A0ISe196d0dO   *2JCTextSize1GCLatex2eA#TextSizeHelpGVe196d0dP%!FC80JccD8bO80PFCtinyGVe196d0eA%!FC80Jc4C8bO80PLCscriptsizeGVe196d0eB%!FC80Jc4B8bO80PNCfootnotesizeGVe196d0eC%!FC80Jc4A8bO80PGCsmallGVe196d0eD%!FC80Jc3P8bO80PLCnormalsizeGVe196d0eE%!FC80Jc3O8bO80PGClargeGVe196d0eF%!FC80Jc3N8bO80PGCLargeGVe196d0eG%!FC80Jc3M8bO80PGCLARGEGVe196d0eH%!FC80Jc3L8bO80PFChugeGVe196d0eI%!FC80Jc3K8bO80PFCHugeN8bOIN0E18fPIN2A0B8bOIN0E1n)''.

A general purpose template for lists wherein the user defines the layout is called
8fPIN2A0<8bO1AN0E1List(DIY).

This template is for users who  are not content with the standard 8fPHN2A09 list making
environments but wish to design their own list structures. Note that it is possible to
customise the description, enumerate and itemize environments. A detailed
description of how to do this can be found in ``The 8fPHN2A09 Companion'' by Goossens,
Mittelbach and Samarin, Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., 1994.

To design your own list, first enter version 8fPIN2A0<8bOLN0E1List into your document. You will see that
you must fill three place holders. The third of  these is named ``items'' and must be
filled with the entries of the list. Make this place holder the target selection and click
on one of the two 8fPIN2A0<8bOLN0E1Item versions of the template. A template for the first item of the
list will be inserted into the  place holder. If version 8fPIN2A0<8bO1BN0E1Item-label has been selected
then two place holders are provided and the user must not only enter the text of the
item but must also enter the text of the label to be assigned to it. If version
8fPIN2A0<8bO1JN0E1Item-default label has been selected then only one place holder appears and the user
need only enter the text of the entry. To insert a second entry into the list, make the
first item the target selection. Then press either the left or right arrow key on the
keyboard to move the target cursor to either immediately before or after the existing
entry. Now click on one of the 8fPIN2A0<8bOLN0E1Item  versions again and a template for the second
entry in the list will appear on the screen. Continue in this manner until the list is
complete. Note that a list need not consist wholly of items  entered with just one of the
8fPIN2A0<8bOLN0E1Item versions but may have a mixture of both versions. 

Note also that entering the symbols `` [ ''  or `` ] '' into either the ``label'' or the ``text'' place
holder of an 8fPIN2A0<8bOLN0E1Item version may be mistaken for the start or end of an optional
argument by 8fPHN2A09. Enclosing the `` [ ''  or `` ] '' in braces will solve the problem. 8fPHN2A0R
type `` 8fPHN2A0X [ 8fPHN2A0W '' in place of `` [ '' or `` 8fPHN2A0X ] 8fPHN2A0W '' in place of `` ] ''.  Alternatively
enter the square brackets with template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1EN0E1SquareBracket.


We will now return to the other two place holders which were named ``default label''
and ``declarations'' respectively. The first of these is used to specify how an item in
the list is to be labelled if it has been entered with the 8fPIN2A0<8bO1JN0E1Item-default label version of the
template.  You could define the default label to be a bullet (202C) just as in the 8fPIN2A0<8bOON0E1Itemize list
or you could enter a space from the keyboard and no label will appear in the output.
Another possibility is to define a new counter and use that to label the items.  In this
case, the command to generate a new counter (template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1BN0E1NewCounter from group
8fPIN2A0>8bOPN0E1Counters) must precede the list statement. Then insert into the ``default label''
place holder the instructions  specifying how and in which style the value of the
counter  is to be printed. Finally you should insert version 8fPIN2A0<8bONN0E1UseCtr of template
8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1OpsOn  (group 8fPIN2A0>8bOPN0E1Counters), with the name of the new counter in its place holder, 
into the ``declarations'' place holder.  

The final place holder to be filled is labelled ``declarations''. This is where the physical
layout of the list can be specified. On page 113 of the 8fPHN2A09 manual is a diagram
which shows you which lengths the various list parameters control. These length
parameters are available as versions of template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1FN0E1ListParameters. Their values can
be changed with template  8fPIN2A0<8bO1FN0E1Parameters-Ops from group 8fPIN2A0>8bO1EN0E1Preliminaries. For each
parameter whose value you wish to change insert an
instance of this latter template into the ``declarations'' place holder, click on the
appropriate version of template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1FN0E1ListParameters and insert the new or change in length
in the second place holder.  
Finally, as mentioned above if you are using your own counter to label the items of the
list you must also enter version 8fPIN2A0<8bONN0E1UseCtr of template 8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1OpsOn (group 8fPIN2A0>8bOPN0E1Counters)
into this place holder.  


The label of each item is positioned in a box. The fourth version of this template   can be
used to redefine where in this box the  label should be placed. By default the label is
positioned flush right in the box. This version is in fact a specific instance of the general
version 8fPIN2A0<8bO1HN0E1renew def - args of template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1BN0E1NewCommand in group 8fPIN2A0>8bO1CN0E1Definitions. The
place holders for  the ``name'' and ``number of parameters''  have already been filled in
and the user need only insert the new definition of the command. The label is the
parameter to the command and should be referred to in the definition by 8fPHN2A0`1.

The layout of a list is determined by the values in ten parameters. Each of these
is available as a version of this template. You can see clearly how each of
these parameters effect the layout of a list in the diagram
on page 113 of the 8fPHN2A09 manual or on page 62 of
``The 8fPHN2A09 companion''. For those who do
not have either of these books to hand a brief description of these parameters follows:

document---usually into the definition of a new environment.
Unlike template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1AN0E1List(DIY) this  list making environment has no additional place

This template can be used in two ways.
Either click on the version required and then enter the symbol(s) to be accented into the 
place holder or alternatively make the symbol(s)  the target selection and
then click on the required version.

The first ten versions are designed to be used with a single symbol. 
The two versions, 8fPIN2A0<8bOON0E1widehat and 8fPIN2A0<8bO1AN0E1widetilde, should be used when a large hat or  
tilde is required to fit over several symbols. 8fPHN2A09 will try to choose a size that is
appropriate. The screen representation of these two versions is, I'm afraid, not good.

To input an array into a document it is necessary to use three template, 8fPIN2A0<8bO1CN0E1Array-Enter, 
8fPIN2A0<8bO1BN0E1Array-Line and 8fPIN2A0<8bO1GN0E1Array-DummyLine.

First, insert into the document version 8fPIN2A0<8bO1DN0E1array (edit) of template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1CN0E1Array-Enter. Then
insert into the first place holder, ``l'', ``c'' or ``r'' for each column of the array to be entered.
An ``l'' means that the items in the column are to be aligned at the left, an ``r'' means they
are to be aligned at the right and a ``c'' means that they are to be centred.

Next insert into the place holder labelled ``ArrayDummyLine'' the ``8fPIN2A0<8bO1HN0E1enter dummy line''
version of  8fPIN2A0<8bO1GN0E1Array-DummyLine which has the required number of columns. The
purpose of this dummy line is to set the correct tabbing stops for the screen
representation of the array. A line of place holders, one for each column will appear on
the screen. Enter into the first the largest item to be entered into column 1, into the
second the largest item that is to be entered into column 2 and so on for all the columns
of the array. The version of the dummy line can then be changed to a hide version if
desired. Unfortunately it is not possible to hide the contents of the place holders.

We are now ready to enter the array itself. Enter into the place holder labelled
``ArrayLine''  the version 8fPIN2A0<8bO1FN0E1col array line with the required number of columns from
template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1BN0E1Array-Line.  A row of place holders, one for each column, will appear on the
screen. These can now be filled.

If you wish to enter another row into the array but there is no place holder labelled
``ArrayLine'', make the row above or below the place at which  you wish to insert the
row the target selection. Then press either the left or right arrow key in the keyboard
to position the target cursor at the required position. Now click on the appropriate
version of template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1BN0E1Array-Line and an additional row of place holders will appear on
the screen.

To delete a row make it the target  selection and either select 8fPIN2A0<8bONN0E1Delete from the menu
under 8fPIN2A0<8bONN0E1EditOp in the console, or press the keyboard key labelled ``Backspace'' or
press the keyboard combination 8fPIN2A0>8bOKN0E1C-d.

Finally the complete array can be  made the target selection and  its version 
changed to 8fPIN2A0<8bO1DN0E1array (hide) to improve the visual appearance slightly.

It is possible to insert large delimiters into a document.
First click on template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1KN0E1BigDelimiters-Enter and three place holders will be entered into
the document --- one for a left delimiter, one for an expression and one for a right
delimiter. A version from template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1IN0E1BigDelimitersLeft must be entered into the place
holder  named 8fPIN2A0<8bOON0E1BigLeft and a version from template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1JN0E1BigDelimitersRight must be
entered into  that named 8fPIN2A0<8bOPN0E1BigRight. If you don't want a large delimiter on one side of the
expression then chose the version labelled 8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1blank for the place holder on that side. 

If the expression has already been entered into the document you can instead make it
the target selection and then click on template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1KN0E1BigDelimiters-enter. The two
place holders for the delimiters will then appear on either side of the expression.

Unfortunately, the  representation of the large delimiters on the screen is very primitive.
However, the 8fPHN2A09 output should be satisfactory.

An ellipsis is a sequence of three dots used to indicate omitted text. There are versions
of this template to produce horizontal, vertical and diagonal ellipsis dots.
The final version of the template outputs a centred dot.

To input a  number of displayed equations into a document it is necessary to use  two
templates, 8fPIN2A0<8bO1FN0E1EqnArray-Enter and 8fPIN2A0<8bO1IN0E1EqnArray-Equation.

First, insert into the document a version of template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1FN0E1EqnArray-Enter. There are two
available. If the first is selected, then by default, all the equations will be numbered.
It is however possible to indicate when entering the equations if a particular equation
should not be numbered. With the second version, none of the equations will be numbered.

After selecting  a version of template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1FN0E1EqnArray-Enter  either four or three
place holders will appear on the screen. The last of these is
a place holder for the equations and the others are used to set the tabbing stops
for the 8fPIN2A0D8bONN0E1screen version of the group of equations.

If the first version has been chosen then there  are three place holders
with which to set the tabbing stops.  Enter into
the one named ``label'' the longest label that you are intending to give to an equation
in the group of equations. If you are not intending to label any of the equations enter a few
spaces with the space bar instead.
(A label can be given to an equation so that the equation can be referred to without knowing
how it will be numbered in the final output.) Enter into the place holders labelled ``LHS''
and ``Op.'' the longest left-hand side  and the biggest operator symbol that will appear
in an equation in the group of equations. 

If the second version has been chosen then no place holder named ``label'' will appear.
Fill the place holders labelled ``LHS''and ``Op.'' as for the first version.

You are now ready to enter the equations themselves. This is done
with template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1IN0E1EqnArray-Equation. If version 8fPIN2A0<8bO1FN0E1Eqnarray (Nos) of 8fPIN2A0<8bO1FN0E1EqnArray-Enter
has been entered into the document then use a version
with 8fPIN2A0<8bO1FN0E1Eqnarray (Nos) in its name. If however version 8fPIN2A0<8bO1IN0E1Eqnarray (No Nos) of 
8fPIN2A0<8bO1FN0E1EqnArray-Enter has been used then use the version with 8fPIN2A0<8bO1IN0E1Eqnarray (No Nos) in 
its name.

Make the place holder, labelled ``Equation'' the target selection  and click on one
of the versions of  template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1IN0E1EqnArray-Equation. 
The possibilities
available are: 

8fPIN2A08D8bOLN0E18fPJN2A08C8bO12HN0E1This has three place holders, one for the left-hand side of the 
equation, one for the right-hand side of the equation and one for an operator.
Use this version if version 8fPIN2A0<8bO1FN0E1Eqnarray (Nos) of template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1FN0E1EqnArray-Enter was

place holder for a label.  This  enables the user to refer to a particular equation
without knowing how it will be  numbered  in the 8fPHN2A09 output.  Suppose that
an equation was inserted into a document with a version which has a
place holder for a label and suppose that the label entered was ``8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1RuleA''.
Then to refer to this equation at other places in the document  select either
version 8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1(Ref) or 8fPIN2A0<8bOKN0E1Ref from template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1GN0E1Ref(within doc) and insert 8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1RuleA
into its place holder. Note that the  8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1(Ref) and  8fPIN2A0<8bOKN0E1Ref versions only print the
number of the equation and if any text such as ``equation'' is required then it 
must be inserted  by the user. Remember that two consecutive runs of 8fPHN2A09
on the document may be required in order that references to equations  within
the document are output correctly.8bN2GN0E2Equation-label  -(Eqnarray Nos)8fPJN2A08C8bObDN0E1This version should only be used

If you wish to enter another equation into the group of
equations but there is no place holder labelled
``Equation'', make the equation above or below the place at which  you wish to insert the
equation the target selection. Then press either the left or right arrow key at the keyboard
to position the target cursor at the required position. Next click on the appropriate
version of template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1IN0E1EqnArray-Equation and an additional row
of place holders will appear on
the screen.

To delete an equation make it the target  selection and either select 8fPIN2A0<8bONN0E1Delete from the menu
under 8fPIN2A0<8bONN0E1EditOp in the console, or press the keyboard key labelled ``Backspace'' or
press the keyboard combination 8fPIN2A0>8bOKN0E1C-d.

8fPIN2A0D8bO5NN0E1Note that the 8fPHN2A09 output from this template is not identical to that shown on the screen.  In
the 8fPHN2A09 output the mathematics will be centred unless the 8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1fleqn document class
option has been selected. In that case the mathematics will begin at a distance
8fPIN2A0<8bO1BN0E1mathindent from the left hand margin. If this parameter has not been set or doesn't
have an appropriate value it can be changed with template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1HN0E1Parameters-OpsOn,
inserting 8fPIN2A0<8bO1BN0E1mathindent  from template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1BN0E1Parameters into the chosen command.   In
addition an equation will be numbered at the right  in the final output  unless the
8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1leqno document class option has been selected in which case it is numbered on the
left. 

In the screen version the mathematics always begins a fixed distance from the left margin.
Numbered equations are not labelled with a number on the screen but with  either  ``8fPIN2A0B8bOJN0E1no''
or by the contents of the  place holder for the label placed  between parentheses at the left of
the equation. These labels are always positioned at the left on the screen regardless of
whether 8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1leqno has been selected for the document or not.

This template can be used to enter mathematics which is to be displayed. That is,  extra
vertical space is required above and below  it on the page of output. 

Template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1HN0E1Equation/Display  has 6 versions --- two are labelled  ``Displayed
expression'' and four are labelled ``Equation''. With this template we use  ``Displayed
expression'' and ``Equation'' to refer to  non-numbered and numbered lines
of displayed mathematics respectively.

If the displayed item is to be terminated with text (such as a punctuation symbol)  then
a version with ``followed by text'' in its name should be chosen and the text entered into 
the text place holder provided. 

Finally there are versions  for  equations which have  a place holder for a label. This 
enables the user to refer to a particular equation without knowing how it will be 
numbered  in the 8fPHN2A09 output. 
Suppose that an equation was inserted into a document with a version which has a
place holder for a label and suppose that the label entered was ``8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1RuleA''. Then
to refer to this equation at other places in the document  select either version 8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1(Ref) or
8fPIN2A0<8bOKN0E1Ref from template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1GN0E1Ref(within doc) and insert 8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1RuleA into its place holder.
Note that the  8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1(Ref) and  8fPIN2A0<8bOKN0E1Ref versions only print the number of the equation and if
any text such as ``equation'' is required then it  must be inserted  by the
user. Remember that two consecutive runs of 8fPHN2A09 on the document may be required in
order that references to equations  within the document are output correctly.  


8fPIN2A0D8bO5NN0E1Note that the 8fPHN2A09 output from this template is not identical to that shown on the screen.  In
the 8fPHN2A09 output the mathematics will be centred unless the 8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1fleqn document class
option has been selected. In that case the mathematics will begin at a distance
8fPIN2A0<8bO1BN0E1mathindent from the left hand margin. If this parameter has not been set or doesn't
have an appropriate value it can be changed with template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1HN0E1Parameters-OpsOn,
inserting 8fPIN2A0<8bO1BN0E1mathindent  from template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1BN0E1Parameters into the chosen command.   In
addition an equation will be numbered at the right  in the final output  unless the
8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1leqno document class option has been selected in which case it is numbered on the
left. 

In the screen version the mathematics always begins a fixed distance from the left margin.
Equations are not numbered but are labelled either with ``8fPIN2A0B8bOJN0E1no'' or by the contents of the
place holder for the label between parentheses at the left on the screen. These labels are
always positioned at the left on the screen  regardless of whether 8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1leqno has been selected
for the document or not.

The versions of this template can be used to insert fractions into the document.
There is a version provided for in-line mathematics but in such cases  a sloping
line is often used to indicate division instead.

The four versions of this template can be used to insert integrals into the document.
There are versions for use in either  displayed or in-line mathematics.
There are also versions for integrals with and without limits.
The two versions for definite integrals have three place holders, one for the expression
and two for the limits. The other two versions, for indefinite integrals, have
just the place holder for the expression.

Click on the required version and enter the expression and (if necessary)
the limit place holders.  If the expression to be preceded by the
integral sign has already been entered into the document, make it the 
target selection and then click on the required version. The integral sign
(and possibly place holders for the limits) will appear.

The versions of this template can be used to insert limits into the document.
There are versions for  use in  either displayed or  in-line mathematics.
Each version has two place holders, one for the expression and the one for the
limiting condition.


Click on the required version and fill the two place holders.  
If the expression has already been entered into the document, 
make it the target selection and then click on the required version. The limit

This template is only intended to be used when mathematics is inserted  into a document
by means of pure 8fPHN2A09 commands. It can be used, for example, to increase or decrease
the space around an operator. 

If 8fPHN2A0  is being used in the usual manner with stencils and place holders, then the
space around operators grows automatically as the complexity  of the operands increases.
The space in this case can be increased or decreased by making the operator the target 
selection and then typing either 8fPIN2A0>8bOKN0E1C-+ or 8fPIN2A0>8bOKN0E1C-221C  respectively.

An equation that is so long that it must be split over more than one line can be entered
into a document with this pair of templates.

First enter into the document one of the versions of template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1FN0E1SplitEqn-Enter.
There are three available.

8fPIN2A08D8bOKN0E18fPJN2A08C8bO3cGN0E1Use this version if you wish the equation
to be numbered and you wish to assign a label to it.  If a label is given to an
equation then it can be referred to  at other places in the document without
knowing how it will be numbered in the final output. Thus if  the number of the
equation in the printed document changes (due to the addition or deletion of an
equation) then it is not necessary to alter the number of the equation in the
cross reference as this will be changed automatically. To refer to this equation
at  other places in the document  select either version 8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1(Ref) or 8fPIN2A0<8bOKN0E1Ref from
template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1GN0E1Ref(within doc) and insert the  label into the place holder. Note that
the  8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1(Ref) and  8fPIN2A0<8bOKN0E1Ref versions only print the number of the equation and if any
text such as ``equation'' is required then it  must be inserted  by the user.
Remember also that two consecutive runs of 8fPHN2A09 on the document may be
required in order that references to equations  within the document are output
correctly.8bN2JN0E2(1) Equation numbered and labelled8fPJN2A08C8bO6GN0E1Use this version if  the
equation is to be numbered but you don't wish to assign a label to it.8bN2NN0E2(2) Equation numbered but not labelled8fPJN2A08C8bO4GN0E1Use this version if you don't wish the
equation to be numbered.8bN2AN0E2(3) Equation not numbered

If you selected the first of these versions enter a label into the place holder provided.

8fPIN2A0B8bO4FN0E1Note the number in the name of the version which you have used and now pin up the
list of versions of template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1KN0E1SplitEqn-LHS/OP/RHS. 
Insert into the ``LHS/OP'' place holder one of the 8fPIN2A0<8bONN0E1LHS/OP versions which has this
8fPIN2A0B8bO1JN0E1number in its name. Separate place holders for ``LHS'' and ``OP'' will appear.
Enter the  left hand side of the equation into the ``LHS'' place holder  and an  operator
into the ``OP'' place holder. These appear in the output on a line by themselves together
with a number if the first version was selected.

The rest of the equation appears on the following line(s). Enter into the ``RHS'' place
holder one of the 8fPIN2A0<8bOKN0E1RHS versions which has the previously mentioned 8fPIN2A0B8bO1JN0E1number in its name. If one
of the first two of these is chosen a place holder labelled ``expression'' appears. Enter into
this a line of mathematics. To enter an additional line move the target cursor to the
start of the next line on the screen and select another 8fPIN2A0<8bOKN0E1RHS version. Such a line often
begins with a binary operator. If this is the case one of the final two versions of the
template should be used. A separate place holder will appear in this case for the operator.

The four versions of this template can be used to insert summations into the document.
There are versions to be used in either  displayed or in-line mathematics.
There are also versions where the range is positioned below the summation sign
and versions where the lower bound is positioned below the summation sign and the
upper bound above it. The latter have three place holders (one for the expression to be
summed and two for the range) whereas the former have just two (one for the
expression and one for the range). Thus, if you change the version from one of these
types to the other you will need to alter the contents of the place holder(s) specifying the
range.

Click on the required version and fill the expression and range place holder(s).   If the
expression to be summed has already been entered into the document, make it the 
target selection and then click on the required version. The summation sign and the
place holder(s) for the range will appear.

Depending upon which version is selected a brace is placed either below or above the
expression entered into the place holder in the output. On the screen the brace is
represented by a line of dots terminated at each end by  a small vertical line.
If either the third or fourth version is chosen there appears not only
a place holder for an expression but also one for a label. The label is placed centrally
above an over brace and centrally below an under brace.

The 14 versions of this template are symbols which are printed in a bigger size  when
 they occur in ``displaystyle'' to that printed when they occur in ``textstyle''.
Displaystyle is the default style for displayed mathematics, and textstyle the default style for
mathematics in running text.  The difference in size can be seen in the table below. 
Use template 8fPIN2A0<8bOPN0E1MathSize (in section 8fPIN2A0>8bOMN0E1Fonts) if you wish to

The templates in this section have been made purely as an aid to typing  the document.

8fPHN2A09 assumes that a period followed by a space and not preceded by a capital letter is
marking the end of a sentence. If this is not what is intended then the space following 
the period must be entered in a special way.

It is a
problem which often occurs with abbreviations and so several commonly used
abbreviations have been stored as versions of this template. Thus when entering an
abbreviation with a version of this template the space is automatically entered for you. 
There are at present versions for the following abbreviations:

The set of templates in this section can be used to make pictures. However only very
basic pictures can be made with the standard 8fPHN2A09 commands. A picture is considered
by 8fPHN2A09 to be a large object to be placed on the line of text being processed. If you don't wish it
to be placed on the line but wish it instead to be displayed then
insert it into a displayed expression holder or into, for example, the centred version of
template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1DN0E1Layout-c,l,r. Pictures, particularly if they are large, are often entered into 
a document as a object which can ``float'' to other positions in the text.
 The 8fPIN2A0<8bONN0E1figure template can be used for this.

8fPJN2A0-8bO1EN0E1Picture-Enter8bNIN0E28fPHN2A02

Use one of the ``enter'' versions of this template to insert a picture environment into
your document. There is a choice of two.  Both versions have place holders into which
must be entered the  dimensions of the picture. The units of length we call picture units,
pu for short. By default this is 1 pt which is about 0.35mm. The value of the unit length
can be altered using version 8fPIN2A0<8bO1BN0E1Set length of template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1HN0E1Parameters-OpsOn. Insert into
the ``name'' place holder version 8fPIN2A0<8bO1NN0E1unitlength in pictures from template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1BN0E1Parameters.
Insert into the other place holder the new value not forgetting to include the units.
These may be  8fPIN2A0<8bOJN0E1cm, 8fPIN2A0<8bOJN0E1mm, 8fPIN2A0<8bOJN0E1in, 8fPIN2A0<8bOJN0E1em, 8fPIN2A0<8bOJN0E1ex, 8fPIN2A0<8bOJN0E1pc or 8fPIN2A0<8bOJN0E1pt.

The difference between the two versions is the position of the origin of the picture. With the first
version it is at the bottom left-hand corner of the picture while with the other version you can
specify the position of the origin.  This is done by inputting into the two place holders provided the 
8fPIN2A0B8bOIN0E1x and 8fPIN2A0B8bOIN0E1y co-ordinates of the lower left-hand corner of the picture relative to this new origin.   
(The horizontal axis is the 8fPIN2A0B8bOIN0E1x axis and the vertical axis is the 8fPIN2A0B8bOIN0E1y axis.)

The final place holder is named ``picture-commands'' and can be filled with commands
from template 8fPIN2A0<8bOPN0E1Commands.

The version of the 8fPIN2A0<8bO1EN0E1Picture-Enter template can be changed to a ``hide'' version if required.
In this case the dimensions and specification of the origin of the picture are not shown on the
screen.

There are six versions of this template. However only the first two, 8fPIN2A0<8bOKN0E1PUT and
8fPIN2A0<8bOPN0E1MultiPUT,
have been tested as the 8fPHN2A09 commands for drawing curves and grids are not
available on my computer.

8fPIN2A08D8bOON0E18fPJN2A08C8bO14PN0E1This command is used to enter something into the picture. This may be  a
piece of text, a boxed item or an object, such as a circle. Objects can be selected
from template 8fPIN2A0<8bOON0E1Objects and boxed items can be made with template 8fPIN2A0<8bOMN0E1Boxes.
 The 8fPIN2A0B8bOIN0E1x and 8fPIN2A0B8bOIN0E1y co-ordinates at which the item is to be placed must be  entered
into the other two place holders.8bNKN0E2PUT8fPJN2A08C8bO2bDN0E1This command can be used instead of a sequence of 8fPIN2A0<8bOKN0E1PUT commands
whenever several copies of an object are to be inserted
at regular intervals into a picture.  Input the 8fPIN2A0B8bOIN0E1x and 8fPIN2A0B8bOIN0E1y co-ordinates of
the position at which the first copy of the object is to be placed. 
Subtract the value of this 8fPIN2A0B8bOIN0E1x  co-ordinate from that of the position where the second copy is to 
be placed and enter the value obtained into the place holder labelled ``8fPIN2A0B8bOJN0E1dx''.
Similarly enter the difference in the 8fPIN2A0B8bOIN0E1y  co-ordinates into ``8fPIN2A0B8bOJN0E1dy''. Finally enter the

This template can be used to enter various objects into a picture. The appropriate
version is usually entered into the place holder of either version 8fPIN2A0<8bOKN0E1PUT or 8fPIN2A0<8bOPN0E1MultiPUT
of template 8fPIN2A0<8bOPN0E1Commands which specifies where the object must be placed.
The objects available at present are given below.

8fPJN2A0-8bOLN0E1Line8bNIN0E28fPHN2A01
There are two versions for entering a line. One is for a vertical line and the other for
any non-vertical line. The line starts from a point whose co-ordinates are 
determined by the contents of the place holders of  the 8fPIN2A0<8bOKN0E1PUT or
8fPIN2A0<8bOPN0E1MultiPUT command.  

The version for a vertical line has just one place holder
into which should be entered the length of the line to be drawn in 8fPIN2A0<8bOJN0E1pu (picture units).
Don't enter the units of length---they are assumed to be 8fPIN2A0<8bOJN0E1pu.
See the help file for template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1EN0E1Picture-enter if you don't know what these are. 

The version which is used for non-vertical lines is more complicated. This time there
are three place holders, two of which are used to specify the angle, 3bI, that the line
makes to the horizontal axis and one which specifies the length of the line to be drawn.
8fPHN2A09  can only draw lines for a limited number of
slopes. The user may only  specify angles  to the horizontal which satisfy the following
formula.

In a right-angled triangle the tangent of an angle 3bI, which is not the right-angle, is
calculated by  dividing the length of the side of the triangle opposite it by the length of
the smaller side adjacent to it. (8fPHN2A0R not the hypotenuse.)

The final place holder for the version for non-vertical lines determines the length of the
line to be drawn. You must enter the length of the projection of the line onto the 8fPIN2A0B8bOIN0E1x-axis.
This is the difference between the 8fPIN2A0B8bOIN0E1x co-ordinates of the end points of the line.
Don't enter the units of length---they are assumed to be 8fPIN2A0<8bOJN0E1pu.
If a horizontal line is to be drawn then this of course will be the same as the length of
the line itself  but otherwise it will be different.  

8fPHN2A09 will not draw very short sloping lines. Anything shorter than about
10pt will be omitted from the picture.

Just as for drawing lines there are two versions of this template for drawing
arrows--- one for arrows in a vertical direction and another for arrows in a
non-vertical direction. The place holders are precisely the same as those 
for lines which are described in the subsection above.

The line starts from a point whose co-ordinates are 
determined by the contents of the place holders of  the 8fPIN2A0<8bOKN0E1PUT or
8fPIN2A0<8bOPN0E1MultiPUT command. The arrow points away from this starting point.

place holders of the 8fPIN2A0<8bOKN0E1PUT or 8fPIN2A0<8bOPN0E1MultiPUT command.

The  versions available are:

Enter one or a pair of the following characters---``t'',``b'',``l'',``r'',``c''. They stand for
top, bottom, left, right and centre respectively. Thus if ``tl'' was entered into the

If there is a bit of a picture which is repeated several times in one or more pictures
it can be advantageous to  save it  in a named box and call the box wherever it
is needed. As the contents of the box are only processed once by 8fPHN2A09 
this can save processing time especially if the box contains sloping lines.
However once you have finished  using the saved box its contents should be destroyed
to save storage space. Select version 8fPIN2A0<8bO1HN0E1Destroy save box to do this. 

Create a new save box with the 8fPIN2A0<8bO1KN0E1Create new save box version of this template. Insert  a name into the
place holder. This should be a string of letters and should not be the name of an existing
command. Uppercase letters are considered to be different from lower case letters. 

You are now ready to define the contents of the save box. Click on version 8fPIN2A0<8bO1PN0E1Define contents save box.
Enter into the first two place holders the  width and height measured in
8fPIN2A0<8bOJN0E1pu (picture units) of the size of the box required. See the help file for template
8fPIN2A0<8bO1EN0E1Picture-enter  if you don't know what these units are. The  third
place holder determines where in the box its contents should be positioned.
Enter one or a pair of the following characters---``t'',``b'',``l'',``r'',``c''. They stand for
top, bottom, left, right and centre respectively. Thus if ``tl'' was entered into the
place holder the contents would be positioned at the top-left corner of the box.
The order of a pair of characters has no significance. Enter into the final
place holder the contents of the box. This could be text or version 8fPIN2A0<8bOKN0E1PUT or 8fPIN2A0<8bOPN0E1MultiPUT of template

Characters obtained by pressing the space bar or the  8fPIN2A0>8bONN0E1return key are  considered
by 8fPHN2A09 to be the same space character. Any  sequence of space characters is
considered to be a sequence of just one space character. Thus if you wish to increase the
space between two typed items it does not help to insert extra spaces with the space bar
between them. The extra spaces will be shown on the screen but will be ignored by
8fPHN2A09 and so will not appear in the final output. 

To insert extra space into a line use this template  or enter straight 8fPHN2A09 
commands from the keyboard. For example, type 
8fPHN2A0Ø  where 8fPIN2A0N8bOIN0E1229E stands for the
character obtained by pressing the space bar to enter an inter-word space into the line.
The special symbol 8fPHN2A0\ can also  used to insert
space but in places where it would be inappropriate to break the line. For example, I
would input my name as H.8fPHN2A0\Backhouse so that the ``H.'' doesn't appear at the end of a
line by itself.

When  text is set in a  typewriter like font  the inter-word space is a fixed length causing a
ragged right-hand or, less usually, left-hand margin. Except when such a font is
specified or you have requested a ``ragged margin'', 8fPHN2A09 will stretch or shrink the
inter-word space  on each line so that the right margin is straight. Thus inserting space by
the methods mentioned in the previous paragraph may not have the desired effect. To
insert an absolute length of space use instead versions 8fPIN2A0<8bO1EN0E1space8fPHN2A0Xlength8fPHN2A0W or 8fPIN2A0<8bO1FN0E1space8fPHN2A0Xlength8fPHN2A0W*
and fill in the length required  (not forgetting the units). Version  8fPIN2A0<8bO1EN0E1space8fPHN2A0Xlength8fPHN2A0W will not
produce any space at the start or end of a line (of output)  but  version 8fPIN2A0<8bO1FN0E1space8fPHN2A0Xlength8fPHN2A0W*

 A completely blank line in the text indicates to 8fPHN2A09 the end of a paragraph. 
Multiple blank lines entered by means of the 8fPIN2A0>8bONN0E1return key are considered by 8fPHN2A09
to be just one blank  line. Thus if you wish to increase the vertical space between two
typed items it does not help to insert extra space between them with the  8fPIN2A0>8bONN0E1return key.
The extra space will be shown on the screen but will be ignored by 8fPHN2A09 and so will
not appear in the final output. 

Note also that a blank line appearing on the screen which has been generated by using
a template may not necessarily  generate a blank line in the corresponding 8fPHN2A09
code. 

Extra vertical space can be added after a line break with the  8fPIN2A0×8bOPN0E1[length]  or 
8fPIN2A0×8bO1AN0E1*[length] versions
from template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1AN0E1LineBreak. Set the place holder to the length of the  extra vertical
space required. (Don't forget the units of length.)

Otherwise to insert extra vertical space into  the document use this template  or enter
pure 8fPHN2A09  commands from the keyboard. 

It is usual to enter the versions of this template between paragraphs. Certain versions
in fact can only be inserted between paragraphs.  If a version is inserted between
paragraphs then the extra vertical space will appear there. If it is inserted in the
middle of a line (of 8fPHN2A09 output) the extra vertical space is added immediately  after
the  end of that line of output.

8fPHN2A09 provides two types of environments with which to

Unfortunately it was not easy to write a good set of stencils for the tabular environment.
Those provided here allow for only a limited choice in design of tabular layout.
It may be that you have to either make your own templates or use pure
8fPHN2A09 in order to input the design you want.
The templates for the tabbing environment on the other hand should meet your needs.


8fPIN2A0"8bO1CN0E1TabularHelp8fPJN2A0-8bNIN0E28fPHN2A028bO2EN0E1Tabular-Enter, -Row and -Line 

Three templates, 8fPIN2A0<8bO1EN0E1Tabular-Enter, 8fPIN2A0<8bO1CN0E1Tabular-Row and 8fPIN2A0<8bO1DN0E1Tabular-Line, can be used in
combination to enter a tabular environment into a document. However they are,
unfortunately, not very flexible. The table is always framed with horizontal and vertical
lines, a horizontal line is inserted between the headings of the columns and the body of the
table, and vertical lines are inserted between each column. The template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1DN0E1Tabular-Line
does allow the user to add partial or  full width  horizontal lines at other places in the table
but even so you may find that  the three templates provided are inadequate for your
purposes.  In this case either enter the 8fPHN2A09 commands necessary to make the table
directly into the document or use these templates as a guide in order to construct your
own templates. Versions of the templates are provided for tables of at most 6 columns. If
your table has more columns than this you should add the necessary versions to each of
the three templates. 

First enter into the document the version of template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1EN0E1Tabular-Enter with
the required number of columns. The first place holder of each version 
determines how the  entries in the columns are to be aligned. For each column
you must enter either a ``c'', ``l'' or ``r''. These stand for ``centre the items in the column'',
``align the entries at the left'' and ``align the entries at the right'' respectively.
The code for each column must be preceded and followed by the ``|'' symbol.
Thus ``|c|c|'' would be entered into the place holder
for a two-column table in which the items are to be centred in the
columns.

There are also place holders for each column of the table. Insert into these the
heading required for each column. 

If you press the right arrow key on the
keyboard after entering the heading of your last column you will see that a
black rectangle to the left of the bottom horizontal line becomes the target selection. 
This is the place holder into which the rows of the table are entered.
Click on the appropriate version of template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1CN0E1Tabular-Row and a row will be entered
into the table with a place holder for each column of the table. Enter the table items
into these place holders. 

To enter another row into the table  move the target
selection with the right or left arrow keys to a position at the left of the
table. If the target selection (cursor) is positioned to the left of
the first row of the table it will appear on the leftmost vertical
line of the table. If it is positioned to the left of any other row it will appear
just to the left of the vertical line. Click again on the appropriate
version of template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1CN0E1Tabular-Row and a row will be inserted
before the row of items which were to the right of the cursor.
Continue in the same fashion to add more rows.
To delete a row of the table make the whole row the target selection and 
then press 8fPIN2A0>8bOKN0E1C-d on the keyboard or click on 8fPIN2A0<8bONN0E1Delete under the 8fPIN2A0<8bONN0E1EditOp button
in the console.

It is possible to draw horizontal lines  in the table 
with template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1DN0E1Tabular-Line. They can cross
 the full width of the table or  just
a few columns. To position a full or partial line in the table position the cursor, as
before, to the left of the row of items which are to be just beneath the horizontal
line. For a full width line choose the version 8fPIN2A0<8bO1ON0E1horiz line full width-(8fPIN2A0B8bOIN0E1n 8fPIN2A0<8bOLN0E1col)

and a line will appear in your table.

To draw a line which is not the full width of the table select instead
version 8fPIN2A0<8bO1PN0E1partial horiz line-enter.
If a line is to be drawn from the left edge of column 8fPIN2A0B8bOIN0E1i to the right edge
of column 8fPIN2A0B8bOIN0E1j where  8fPKN0A08fPIN0A0i8ePHN2B010H8fPIN0A0j  then enter into the first place holder 8fPIN2A0B8bOIN0E1i
and into the second place holder 8fPIN2A0B8bOIN0E1j.
Although the line does not appear on the screen it will appear in the final output.
It is possible to change the version to 8fPIN2A0<8bO1ON0E1partial horiz line-hide
and then a short line appears on the screen instead of the instruction.
However the line does not appear in the correct place.

It is possible to enter several partial line instructions between two rows of the table.
They appear one under each other on the screen but will appear on the same line of
the page in the final output. If there are more than one partial line instructions
between two rows of the table then the order in which they are inserted into the table
is not relevant.

With these three templates it is possible
to make a straight-forward tabbing environment. They are intended for
making simple tabbing environments consisting
of columns of items. The tabbing stops are set with a 
``kill-line''.
If you wish to input a more complicated tabbing environment
you should either enter pure 8fPHN2A09 or use  template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1EN0E1Tabbing-Enter in
conjunction with template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1HN0E1Tabbing-Row(DIY).  A description
of how to do the latter is given in section Tabbing(DIY) below.
Alternatively write versions specifically for your  application and
add them to template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1CN0E1Tabbing-Row.

First enter into the document version 8fPIN2A0<8bO1FN0E1Edit kill-line of template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1EN0E1Tabbing-Enter into
your document. There are two place holders. The first is labelled ``kill-line'' and  into
this should be entered  a version of template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1HN0E1Tabbing-KillLine. Click on the version
with the number of columns you require.  If this is 8fPIN2A0B8bOIN0E1n, then a row of 8fPKN1A08fPIN0A0n8ePHN2B0Ü8fPIN0A01 place holders
will appear. Enter into the first of these either an item of text or mathematics and/or
some horizontal space. The latter can be entered, for example with version
8fPIN2A0<8bO1LN0E1spacelength8fPHN2A0Xlength8fPHN2A0W* from template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1BN0E1Horizontal (group 8fPIN2A0>8bOON0E1Spacing). The first tabbing stop is set
immediately after the contents of this place holder. If  you insert horizontal space at
the start of this place holder be certain to use  a version of 
template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1BN0E1Horizontal (group 8fPIN2A0>8bOON0E1Spacing) which  will insert space at the start of a line. These are marked in the template menu
with an asterisk (*). Then fill in a similar manner the remaining 8fPKN1A08fPIN0A0n8ePHN2B0Ü8fPIN0A02 place holders.
With these it is not necessary to use a horizontal space version with an asterisk. 
The  stops for the tabbing environment are determined by this row. The end of it
is marked with ``8fPIN2A0N8bOIN0E18fPIN2A0B8bOLN0E1kill'' on the screen. This row will not appear in the 8fPHN2A09 output.

Remember that  several spaces entered from the keyboard are treated by 8fPHN2A09
as if there was only one space present. Thus, although it may look on the screen as if you
have moved the tab stops to the right by inserting spaces in this way in reality you 
haven't. 

The second place holder of version 8fPIN2A0<8bO1FN0E1Edit kill-line from template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1EN0E1Tabbing-Enter
is labelled ``Tabbing-Row(s)'' and  into
this should be entered  one or more versions of template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1CN0E1Tabbing-Row.

another row before or after this one, make the whole row the target selection and
press  either the left  or right arrow on the keyboard. The target cursor will 
move to  immediately before the first item or after the last item in the row respectively.
Click on version 8fPIN2A0<8bO1AN0E18fPIN0A0n col row and place holders for the items of the new row
will appear for you. Continue in this manner adding rows until
you have entered everything into the tabbing environment.

To delete a row from the tabbing environment make the whole row the target selection and 
then press 8fPIN2A0>8bOKN0E1C-d on the keyboard or click on 8fPIN2A0<8bONN0E1Delete under the 8fPIN2A0<8bONN0E1EditOp button
in the console.


Finally, if you wish you can select the whole tabbing environment and change the
version to 8fPIN2A0<8bO1FN0E1Hide kill-line. The ``kill-line'', 8fPIN2A0B8bO1EN0E1Begin tabbing and 8fPIN2A0B8bO1CN0E1End tabbing
will then disappear.

These two templates can be used in combination to make 
a complicated tabbing environment.
If, however, you wish to make a straight-forward tabbing environment
with items aligned in columns you should use template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1EN0E1Tabbing-Enter
in conjunction with templates 8fPIN2A0<8bO1HN0E1Tabbing-KillLine and 8fPIN2A0<8bO1CN0E1Tabbing-Row.


First enter version 8fPIN2A0<8bO1EN0E1Tabbing (DIY) from template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1EN0E1Tabbing-Enter into your document.
There is just one place holder which is filled with  text interspersed with instances of
versions of template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1HN0E1Tabbing-Row(DIY).

The end of all but the last line of the tabbing environment 
must be marked. If the line
is a dummy line just entered to set the tab stops then terminate it with version
8fPIN2A0<8bO1DN0E1end kill row.  (You can use template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1HN0E1Tabbing-KillLine to enter such a line if you wish.)
Otherwise terminate a line with a  version with ``8fPIN2A0<8bOPN0E1end line'' in its
name.

Note that if you have a standard row of 8fPIN0A0n items in your
tabbing environment then don't use a version of template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1CN0E1Tabbing-Row to enter it.
Use instead a version of template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1HN0E1Tabbing-Row(DIY). 

The versions of this template are used as follows:
8fPIN2A08D8bO1DN0E18fPJN2A08C8bO7IN0E1Set a tab stop at this position. Its presence is marked on the

immediately after the next tab stop. Note that this does not necessarily
imply a move to the next tab position to the right of your current position.
If you have input a lot of text since the previous ``move to the next
tab position'' command then it could result in a move to the left of 
your current position. In this case some of the text on the screen will
probably disappear
while text may be overwritten in the 8fPHN2A09 output.8bN1MN0E2move to next tab stop8fPJN2A08C8bOeJN0E1The left hand margin of the tabbing

It  eliminates the effect of a 8fPIN2A0<8bO2MN0E1move left margin one tab to the right command
for this line.  Although the 8fPHN2A09 output should be fine the screen version
is not. There it appears as though the margin has not been moved at all.
Thus if possible 8fPIN2A0B8bO1PN0E1avoid using this command. Usually the same effect can be achieved
by inserting a 8fPIN2A0<8bO2LN0E1move left margin one tab to the left on the previous line and
a 8fPIN2A0<8bO2MN0E1move left margin one tab to the right at the end of the current line.

You can, if you prefer, enter such a  line instead  with a version of template

Remember that  several spaces entered from the keyboard are treated by 8fPHN2A09
as if there was only one space present. Thus although it may look on the screen as if you
have moved tab stops to the right by inserting spaces in this way, in reality you 
haven't. Use  template 8fPIN2A0<8bO1BN0E1Horizontal (group 8fPIN2A0>8bOON0E1Spacing)
