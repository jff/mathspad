Once upon a time, in the days before computers became widely used, authors of books
and articles would produce a typescript of their work; before going to the printing office
where the typescript was set in lead, a ``copy-editor'' would mark the typescript with
all sorts of hieroglyphics.  The hieroglyphics acted as a secret code between the editor
and the printer (a human being, by the way) and served to tell the printer such things
as when to use particular fonts (for example bold characters) and where to position text
on the page.  Mathematical texts were regarded as ``difficult copy'' and incurred a
financial penalty. 

Copy-editors still do exist, although for mathematical texts at least their function is
rapidly being usurped by the authors themselves.  The hieroglyphics used by the
copy-editors are also being replaced by the  so-called ``mark-up'' languages like ^fPHN2A0ISe1cfa44M   %2GcLaTeX1CcLatex2e#LaTeXHelpGVe1cfa44N#!1FCL4cA1JA1L 1M1NPT1K1L1K1L1ME1N1M1NXKCJ\LaTeX{}GVe1cfa44O#!MCT1K1L1K1L1ME1N1M1NXICJ\TeX{}GVe1cfa45A#!1HCL4cA1JA1L 1M1NPT1K1L1K1L1ME1N1M1NX226F4ACJ{\mathsurround=0pt\LaTeX $2_L{\textstyle 26F}$\hspace{-0.4mm}}{}GVe1cfa45B#!1BCB4cAIBPT1K1L1K1L1ME1N1M1NX1FCJJ\textsc{Bib}\TeX{}GVe1e4779B#!MC3fMMakeIndex5fMOC3fMMakeIndex5fM{}5\

that automatically interprets the commands of the mark-up language.     

The advantage of the old system was a clear delineation of professional responsibilities. 
The author was responsible for the content, the copy-editor for a professional
appearance.  Computerised systems tend to confuse the two tasks.  Authors are now
responsible for both appearance and content and, if one is not careful, paying attention
to the former can have a detrimental effect on the latter.  Authors no longer pay a
financial penalty for difficult mathematical copy; they pay the penalty instead in their
own time and energy.

The advantage of computerised systems, on the other hand, is improved quality; above
all, the elimination of typographical errors introduced by the printer in the process of
typesetting is a godsend for authors of papers containing substantial amounts of
mathematics.   This one advantage is so significant that very few  authors would wish
to return to the old system.

Nowadays, a battle is raging between the  ``WYSIWYG'' (``What You See Is What You
Get'') and the  ``logical design'' systems.   WYSIWYG systems are dismissed as ``what
you see is ALL you get''  by their opponents,  to which the retort is that logical design
systems may be  ``wonderful'' but they are also  ``awful'' and their users are
``masochists'' ^fPIN2A0ISe1d4818J   $2PcRef(other doc)1LcLatex2e#Ref(other doc)HelpGVe1d4818K'!1HC3fI[2Hdocument key(s)2IbO]5fIKCJ\cite{bO}PCCite[document]GVe1d4818L'!1PC3fI[2Hdocument key2IbO,2Hcomment2IbN]5fINCJ\cite[bN]{bO}1ICCite[document, comment]GVe1d4818M'!2AC3fMNoCite5fM3fI[2Hdocument key(s)2IbO]5fIANCJ\nocite{bO}I2HCDocument not cited-but in bibliographyGVe1d4818N'!2JC3fMPut all references into bibliography.5fMAOCJJ\nocite{*}I2CCPut all entries into bibliography<bOMN0E1\PCMom^\.   The essence of the dispute is that WYSIWYG systems tend
to be easier to use (and to learn to use) but they are less flexible, leading to a lower
quality finished product, and they can encourage authors to waste time on appearance
to the  detriment of  the content.

^fPHN2A0ISafa0e17G   !0GVafa0e17F#!MCJ3fIMath2fCpad5fILCJ\mplogo{}=\  combines the advantages of WYSIWYG and logical design systems in a way
that harks back to the old-fashioned manual system.    It is first and foremost a logical
design system ---logical elements within a  ^fPHN2A0=\ document are defined by
``templates'' and manipulated by a structure editor.  Unlike conventional logical design
systems, however, it is  a ``quasi''-WYSIWYG system in the sense that the readability of
mathematics  displayed on screen is as near to the readability of mathematics in a printed
book as current technology will permit. Moreover, ^fPHN2A0=\ is not a
``what-you-see-is-ALL-you-get'' system.  Nor is it a system that is exclusively for 
mathematicians --- even if the documents you write contain no mathematics whatsoever,
its unique template system can lead to a dramatic improvement in your productivity.

The essence of ^fPHN2A0=\ is that a document is a structure on which two ``views''  are
defined.  One ``view'' is what is displayed on screen; as mentioned earlier, in this view, the
mathematics is as near as possible to the form desired by the user as current technology
permits.  Otherwise the view resembles the galley proofs used in the good old-fashioned
manual type setting systems: the document is not split into pages, equations are not
numbered but named, the position of figures and tables is not fixed, and so on. The second
view is a sequence of commands written in a mark-up language like ^fPHN2A06\.  This second
view, generated automatically when a command to ``output'' the document is given, is used
to create the final document. The first view is what concerns the author, the second view is
what concerns the copy-editor. 

An author using ^fPHN2A0=\ will begin by writing his/her article, using conventional
mathematical notation, concentrating on the content and ignoring all issues of layout, page
breaks, centering etc.  Subsequently, ``copy-editing'' instructions can be added to the
document instructing the  ``printer'' (now software rather than a human being) how to
produce the finished document.  For draft versions of an article or book the instructions can
easily be added by the author himself but for the final version (particularly in the case of a
book) it may be necessary and will often be desirable to call on the services of a professional
copy editor (now titled a ``^fPHN2A06\pert'', perhaps?).

A ^fPHN2A0=\ document ready for processing  will thus resemble an old-fashioned
copy-edited text on its way to the printing department.  Strewn among the author's text
there will be a number of ``commands'' instructing the printer how to set the text --- the
style of headings and page numbering to be used, where page breaks are desired etc. 
Unlike raw mark-up code, however, these commands do not dominate the text; since they
tend to be congregated in certain places, for example in the so-called preamble, the
author's text remains eminently readable.  (Using  raw ^fPHN2A06\, for example, the situation
is quite different since the code needed to typeset mathematics tends to swamp everything
else.)

The ^fPHN2A0=\ system represents a radical departure from existing design philosophies 
making it difficult to describe to newcomers.  The best way to find out what it offers is to just
try it and see.  Installment of the system (given the right platform) is just a single command
and then you are away^fPIN2A07bOfNN0E1\The system can be downloaded from the URL given on
the copyright page; the README file you find there gives full details of the software you
need to install the system.  The system is also available from a number of different 
archiving services.^\.  So, why not  go out and give it a whirl!?

Development of the ^fPHN2A0=\ system was initiated in 1987 by Roland Backhouse with
support from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands and, later,  the NWO (the
Dutch organisation for scientific research).

a design was formulated of a system for on-screen algebraic  calculations.  This prototype
system, implemented by Paul with  technical support from Harm Paas, first
became available for use in 1990.   The principal design element was a flexible system for
on-the-fly definition of  mathematical notations (the ``stencils'' of the current system). 

During 1990 much was learnt from experimenting with Paul's prototype implementation. 
``Guinea pigs'' at that time who provided much useful feedback were Grant Malcolm and Ed
Voermans.  During a period of six months several alterations were made to the ergonomics of
the system as a result of this feedback. In the summer of 1990 Roland Backhouse moved to
Eindhoven University  of Technology and Paul  Chisholm left  the university  world for a post in
industry  in Australia.  The system had settled into a stable state and it was decided to freeze the
development for a while until full  benefit had been gained from its active use.   Ed Voermans
was responsible for  correcting the few bugs that emerged after Paul's departure.  Being a
prototype,  the system had at that time no name.  A paper written by Paul Chisholm outlining 
the system was presented in Paul's absence by Roland Backhouse at the 3rd International
Workshop on Software Engineering and its Applications, Toulouse, France, 3--7 December
1990.

Work on ^fPHN2A0=\ itself  began in March 1992.  Richard Verhoeven and Olaf

Dutch ``afstudeerproject'').  Priorities were to increase the (on-screen) readability of
documents by the use of proportional spacing, the integration of  plain text with
mathematical calculations, and a better, more flexible design of  stencils.  The
transformation system that formed a major part of the existing  prototype was
scrapped because, although the prototype system ^fPIN2A0ISe196d18D   +2KcTextStyle1HcLatex2eA#TextStyleHelpGVe196d18N'!FCJ3fJbO5fJKCJ\emph{bO}1CC3fMEmphasized5fM textGVe196d18E'!DCJbOMCJ\textup{bO}OCUpright shapeGVe196d18F'!FCJ3fMbO5fMMCJ\textit{bO}PC3fMItalic5fM shapeGVe196d18G'!FCJ3fJbO5fJMCJ\textsl{bO}1AC3fJSlanted5fJ shapeGVe196d18H'!DCJbOMCJ\textsc{bO}1FCS4cBMALL4bP4bNC4cBAPS 4bNshapeGVe196d18I'!DCJbOMCJ\textmd{bO}OCMedium seriesGVe196d18J'!FCJ3fObO5fOMCJ\textbf{bO}OC3fOBold5fO seriesGVe196d18K'!DCJbOMCJ\textrm{bO}NCRoman familyGVe196d18L'!FCJ3fIbO5fIMCJ\textsf{bO}1EC3fISans Serif5fI familyGVe196d18M'!FCJ3fHbO5fHMCJ\texttt{bO}1EC3fHTypewriter5fH familyGVe196d18O'!FCJ3fKbO5fK1GCJ\textbf{J\textit{bO}}1NC3fKBold5fK series 3fKItalic5fK shapeKbOKN0E1\had^\ been  intensively used on several

Richard and Olaf graduated in December 1992 and were then employed for a period of
three months to refine their implementation.  After this period Olaf left and has since
joined a similar project at the CWI in Amsterdam.  Richard Verhoeven is currently
employed at Eindhoven University of Technology and is responsible for the further
development of ^fPHN2A0=\.   Ed Voermans suggested the name. The  ^fPHN2A0=\ logo
was designed by Q Design from an original idea by Kevin  Backhouse; the design was
subsequently implemented  in ^fPHN2A0ISe0507b5I   !1JcMetafontGVe0507b6D#!LC3fHMETAFONT5fHNCJ\METAFONT{}L\  by Kevin. 

During 1993, ^fPHN2A0=\ was used intensively by members of the Mathematics of Program
Construction group at Eindhoven University of Technology  and, once again, the feedback
obtained was extremely valuable in improving the system's design. Version 0.31 of the system
was made available via ftp in December, 1993.

Further use of the system after this initial release led to a major revision in the  way files are 
stored, and to the inclusion of extensive help facilities.  These revisions were designed principally
to accommodate co-authorship at a distance. 

We continue to welcome criticism and suggestions on the design.    

We are extremely grateful to all those who have been willing to act as guinea  pigs during periods
when ^fPHN2A0=\ was both unstable and sometimes  unreliable --- Eerke Boiten, Henk
Doornbos, Maarten Fokkinga, Netty van Gasteren, Rik van Geldrop, Paul Hoogendijk, Ed
Knapen,  Ed Voermans, Harold Weffers and Jaap van der Woude.   Hilary Backhouse and
Maarten Fokkinga provided us with many detailed comments on, criticisms of, and corrections
to, the first draft of this manual.  Lambert Meertens has also offered sage and much appreciated
advice from the very  earliest days of the project.

Our biggest thanks go to Hilary Backhouse for her many contributions  which include preparing
the index and appendix,  numerous suggestions for  improving our
English, and for carrying out the task of incorporating a great many alterations to the text.  Of
course, the responsibility for any errors in the text is entirely ours.
