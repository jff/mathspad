It is not necessary to know 8fPHN2A0T well in order to use most of the
templates in this stencil --- the basic information provided in the  chapter titled
``Advice for Newcomers to 8fPHN2A0V'' in the 8fPHN2A04 manual suffices. However in
order to  create templates  and to use the more complicated  templates we recommend
that you consult the 8fPHN2A0V   manual (Leslie Lamport. 8fPIN2A0O8bO4ON0E18fPHN2A0V---A Document
Preparation System.---User's Guide and Reference Manual. 2nd ed.
Addison-Wesley, Reading. 1994). ``The 8fPHN2A0V Companion" by Goossens, Mittelbach
and Samarin, Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., 1994 is also very useful.

The stencil has been prepared by Hilary Backhouse  who has incorporated some, 
mainly the mathematical and tabbing templates,  from the old latex stencil written by
Richard Verhoeven.  The help documents for this stencil were written by Hilary.  For
those reading it from  a hard copy version the chapters correspond to the headings of a
group of templates and the section headings are names of templates.

This document is  a 8fPHN2A04 document and  can be read from the 8fPHN2A04 system by
clicking on help  in the menu under the ``dummy'' template called 8fPIN2A0I8bO1GN0E1latex2e stencil at
the top of the stencil. 

 8fPIN2A0K8bOPN0E1Warning: This stencil is incomplete.  Some templates only provide  versions for  a
selection of the options available for the corresponding 8fPHN2A0T command, while
some 8fPHN2A0T commands have as yet no corresponding template. Occasionally the
user may prefer to create a template version specifically to meet the requirements of
the document in question rather than to use those given. If you need a missing option,
you can either add a new version to the template or enter the 8fPHN2A0T code directly
into the document. 

Because the 8fPIN2A0K8bOON0E1latex2e stencil is so large it can be difficult to find the particular
template that you require. For this reason the stencil has been divided into groups of
templates such that, where possible, the templates in each group have a common
theme. A dummy template at the start of each group generates a bold heading for the
group within the stencil. The groups are as follows:

 Each document to be processed by 8fPHN2A0T  must be assigned a document class.
Those available are 8fPIN2A0Q8bOON0E1article, 8fPIN2A0Q8bONN0E1report, 8fPIN2A0Q8bOLN0E1book, 8fPIN2A0Q8bONN0E1slides  and 8fPIN2A0Q8bONN0E1letter. Default values of
various style parameters are set according to which class type is chosen. Some of these
may be changed either by altering the value of one or more of the variables listed in
template 8fPIN2A0I8bO1BN0E1Parameters or by choosing a version of this template with a text place holder
 and inserting into it the  appropriate options (from template 8fPIN2A0I8bO1DN0E1ClassOptions). 

The 8fPIN2A0I8bO1EN0E1DocumentClass template  should usually be inserted as the first command of  the
preamble. There are two versions for each of the standard class types --- one with
and one without a place holder for options. If a version with a place holder is selected
and more than one option entered into it, then the options must be separated from each
other by commas.

Many users use the same preamble for most of their documents. If this applies to you
then you should consider adding a version which automatically generates the
preamble that you want to use.

A brief description of each class follows. The default options from template
8fPIN2A0I8bO1DN0E1ClassOptions for each class is also given. <

The front matter may include such things as a copyright page, a foreword, a
table of contents and so forth.  The back matter may include a bibliography and
index. The main matter is the  actual contents of the book. By default  the pages
of the front matter  are numbered with Roman numerals   and the main and
back matter with Arabic numerals.   The word ``Chapter''  is omitted from
chapter headings in the front and back matter.  To indicate to 8fPHN2A0T 
where each of these three parts  start, insert 8fPIN2A0I8bO1CN0E1FrontMatter, 8fPIN2A0I8bO1BN0E1MainMatter and

   Each version of this template is an option for determining the style and layout of a
document and is used in combination with template 8fPIN2A0I8bO1EN0E1DocumentClass.

First enter a version of template 8fPIN2A0I8bO1EN0E1DocumentClass into the document. This specifies the
document class. There are versions for each class type with and without a text place
holder. If a version with a text place holder is selected then you can use template
8fPIN2A0I8bO1DN0E1ClassOptions to enter one or more of the standard options into it. Separate multiple
options with commas. The options available are listed below. Following some of the
options, in  brackets, are the  document classes, if any, in which they may 8fPIN2A0Q8bOKN0E1not be used.

 This template is used to load one or more  packages into 8fPHN2A0V.  8fPIN2A0O8bO3AN0E1It may only be
inserted into the preamble of the document. There are two versions of the template the
second of which can be used to specify  any options required.  

The first version has only one place holder into which the name or names of  packages 
are entered. If more than one package is specified then the names must be separated
by commas. 

 The second version has an extra text place holder into which  options can be entered.
Multiple options must be  separated by commas. It is not necessary to enter any options
which already appear as an option to the document class command as these will
automatically be passed to the package. The second place holder is  used to hold the
name or names of the packages required. If more than one package is specified then
any option inserted into the first place holder must be a valid option for each package
in the second place holder. 

The names of packages may be entered directly from the keyboard or  by choosing the
appropriate version of  the 8fPIN2A0I8bO1DN0E1PackageNames template.

 Each page consists of a header, the body of the page and the foot. Certain
characteristics of a page are determined by the document class and the class  options
which have either been chosen or are by default in force. For example, whether the
text is set in one or two columns on a page. With the 8fPIN2A0I8bO1AN0E1PageStyle  template the style of
the header and foot can be altered. The first four versions called 8fPIN2A0I8bOMN0E1Plain, 8fPIN2A0I8bOMN0E1Empty,
8fPIN2A0I8bOPN0E1Headings and 8fPIN2A0I8bO1BN0E1MyHeadings are used to set the normal style for the current and
subsequent pages.  It is possible to specify a different page style for particular pages.  
This is done by inserting a version with 8fPIN2A0I8bOPN0E1ThisPage in its name into the text of the page
in question.


8fPIN2A0\8bOLN0E18fPJN2A0[8bO7NN0E1This is the default  setting. The header of the page is empty  and the page
number is centred at the foot of the page.8bNMN0E2Plain8fPJN2A0[8bO4NN0E1With this  version both the head and foot of the page are left blank. 8bNMN0E2Empty8fPJN2A0[8bO9LN0E1If this version is selected then the foot is empty and the head contains
information determined by the document class together with the page
number.8bNPN0E2Headings8fPJN2A0[8bObPN0E1The user can specify the contents of the head and foot with this
version. It is for experienced 8fPHN2A0V users and is not described here. Consult
the  8fPHN2A0T manual if you wish to use this option.8bN1BN0E2MyHeadings
Note that although the first four versions set the style for the whole document they are
not always applied to every page. For example, if the 8fPIN2A0I8bOPN0E1Headings version is chosen for a
book then  the first page of  each  chapter is set as if the 8fPIN2A0I8bOMN0E1Plain version had been chosen.
This is because the chapter making command itself contains page setting instructions.

When using one of the 8fPIN2A0I8bOPN0E1ThisPage versions you should position the appropriate version
within the text of the page whose page style you wish to specify. If the command 
appears to have no effect, try repositioning it nearer the   bottom of the page after any
commands (such as a chapter command) which can also change the page style.

 Several constraints on the layout of a page of output, such as the width and height of
text on a page,  are determined by the style parameters.  Many of these are stored as
versions of template 8fPIN2A0I8bO1BN0E1Parameters. (Those relating to floats are stored in template
8fPIN2A0I8bO1GN0E1FloatParameters.) The default values assigned to them can be altered by the user as
follows.  First insert into the document  a version of  template 8fPIN2A0I8bO1HN0E1Parameters-OpsOn
and insert into the principal  place holder the name of the required parameter from
template 8fPIN2A0I8bO1BN0E1Parameters. Finally insert the new value or the change to the value
required in the other place holder.  

 A length parameter may be a rubber length, that is, it  is allowed to vary slightly.
8fPHN2A0V length parameters which are rubber usually have 8fPIN2A0Q8bOLN0E1skip in their names. A
change to a rubber length should  leave it as a stretchable length. Remember also when
dealing with lengths to specify the units. This may be 8fPIN2A0I8bOJN0E1cm, 8fPIN2A0I8bOJN0E1mm, 8fPIN2A0I8bOJN0E1in, 8fPIN2A0I8bOJN0E1em,  8fPIN2A0I8bOJN0E1ex, 8fPIN2A0I8bOJN0E1pc or
8fPIN2A0I8bOJN0E1pt.

Most of the parameters are either  lengths or counters. A counter has an integer value.
8fPIN2A0I8bO1GN0E1Baselinestretch, however, is a multiplying factor and can be a decimal number. New
values must be assigned to such parameters  with the 8fPIN2A0I8bO1CN0E1ChangeValue command. 

The parameters included in the template are:

 This template can be used to alter the value of a length parameter, a counter or the
value of a variable. The name of the length parameter, counter or variable is entered
into the  place holder labelled ``name''. (If a system parameter is to be changed enter
the appropriate version from template 8fPIN2A0I8bO1BN0E1Parameters.) Enter into the other place holder
either the new value or the change in value required depending on the command
chosen. Don't forget to enter the units with a length.  This may be  8fPIN2A0I8bOJN0E1cm, 8fPIN2A0I8bOJN0E1mm, 8fPIN2A0I8bOJN0E1in, 8fPIN2A0I8bOJN0E1em,

that  is allowed to vary slightly in value. 8fPHN2A0V length parameters which are rubber
usually have 8fPIN2A0Q8bOLN0E1skip in their names. A change to a rubber length should  leave it as a
stretchable length. The variation in a value  assigned to a rubber length  is indicated
with 8fPIN2A0O8bOLN0E1plus and 8fPIN2A0O8bOMN0E1minus as shown in one of the examples.

The 8fPIN2A0I8bO1CN0E1Set counter and 8fPIN2A0I8bO1FN0E1Add to counter commands are used to assign integer values.  If
the variable can take a real value then the 8fPIN2A0I8bO1DN0E1Change value command must be used.
The style parameter 8fPIN2A0O8bO1GN0E1baselinestretch is an example of such a variable.

As well as the 8fPIN2A0I8bO1BN0E1Set length and 8fPIN2A0I8bO1EN0E1Add to length versions for assigning a value to a length
parameter there are also versions, 8fPIN2A0I8bO1KN0E1Set length to width, 8fPIN2A0I8bO1LN0E1Set length to height and 8fPIN2A0I8bO1KN0E1Set
length to depth. The  first of these, 8fPIN2A0I8bO1KN0E1Set length to width, will set the value of the
parameter whose name is entered into the first place holder equal to the width
necessary to typeset the contents of the second place holder. For example if the text in
the second place holder would occupy 2 cm of space when processed by 8fPHN2A0V then
the command would be assigned a value of 2 cm.

The 8fPIN2A0I8bO1LN0E1Set length to height and 8fPIN2A0I8bO1KN0E1Set length to depth are similar. In the first case the
command is set to the height the text in the second place holder reaches above the
baseline. In the second case it is given the distance that the text descends below the base
line.

the text following that in  file 8fPIN2A0K8bOIN0E1T will also start on a new page.  If these texts should both
 begin on a new page, such as if  file 8fPIN2A0K8bOIN0E1T contains a complete chapter, then this isn't a
problem but otherwise it could be.

The advantage of using an 8fPIN2A0I8bO1HN0E1Include File 8fPHN2A0t8fPIN2A0K8bOIN0E1T8fPHN2A0s  command is if you wish to run  8fPHN2A0V
on just a part of the document. This might be the case if a change has only been made
to one  section for example.  To do so insert into the preamble the 8fPIN2A0I8bO1JN0E1Include Only Files
command (which is a version of the 8fPIN2A0I8bOPN0E1Preamble template). Into  the place holder of this

The first two versions of this template are for the sender's name and address. If these
are the same for each letter then they can be inserted into the preamble. Otherwise
insert them before the start of each letter. Into the place holder of each template insert

Next insert one of the two 8fPIN2A0I8bONN0E1Letter templates into the body of the document. The first
will date the letter with the current date, the other contains a place holder with which
to specify the date. If a different date is to be used for all the letters it is easier to insert

The two 8fPIN2A0I8bONN0E1Letter templates  include place holders for the recipient's name and  address,
the opening greeting, the letter itself, the closing words and a final one into which can
be inserted one or more of versions 8fPIN2A0I8bO1GN0E1cc, encl and PS. If you don't need to enter any of
templates 8fPIN2A0I8bO1GN0E1cc, encl and PS into your letter enter instead a space into the final place
holder. As before multiple lines in the recipient's name and address must be separated

 This template is intended for use with the slides document class.

overlay up  with that on the slide insert the text from the slide onto  the overlay
as well but colored white to make it invisible.  The command for inserting text
in color can be found in template 8fPIN2A0I8bOMN0E1Color. Overlays are numbered as follows:
the first overlay to slide 8fPIN2A0O8bOIN0E1s is numbered 8fPIN2A0O8bOIN0E1s-a, the second overlay to slide 8fPIN2A0O8bOIN0E1s is

numbered as follows: the first note referring to slide 8fPIN2A0O8bOIN0E1s is numbered 8fPIN2A0O8bOIN0E1s-1, the

slides. It must be  inserted into the 8fPIN2A0O8bOPN0E1preamble of the document. Enter into the
place holder the numbers of the slides required in  ascending order. Each
number in a list of numbers should be separated from the following number by
a comma. It is always possible to specify a range of slide numbers. For example,
1-5 would indicate that slides 1 to 5 inclusive should be printed. If any of the
slides in the list has overlays then these will also be printed. The number of a 
non-existent slide in the list does not cause an error, however an empty list
does. 8bN1IN0E2Print only slides8fPJN2A0[8bO1dGN0E1This is similar to the 8fPIN2A0I8bO1IN0E1Print only slides version except it is for
notes and not slides. Insert into the place holder the number(s) of the slides to
which the note(s) pertain. For example, if you only wish to print the notes
referring to slide 5 then insert into the place holder the number 5. Several
numbers or ranges of numbers separated by commas can be entered into the
place holder just as for version 8fPIN2A0I8bO1IN0E1Print only slides. E.g., 8fPIN2A0O8bO2BN0E1Print only notes to

 An abstract can be entered with this template except in a  book document class where
it  will cause an error.  

An abstract in an article document class will appear where it is positioned in the text 
unless the 8fPIN2A0I8bO1AN0E1TitlePage option is inserted into the list of class options in which case it will
appear on a page by itself.

The 8fPIN2A0I8bO1AN0E1TitlePage option is the default for classes other than article.   The 8fPIN2A0I8bO1CN0E1NoTitlePage
option should be chosen in the case of such classes if it is not desired to place the
abstract on a separate page.

 This template can be used to enter accented characters. Click on the required version
and then enter the appropriate character from the keyboard into the place holder. 
Alternatively, set the target to  the character and then click on the required  version.
There are also versions for a dotless i and a dotless j for use with the other versions of
this template. Unfortunately, the dotless i and j have the same appearance on the
screen regardless of the font chosen. The printed output should be okay.

 This template should be inserted into the document if there are any appendices. Insert
it just before the start of the first appendix. This template does not itself produce any
output but alters the output produced by the sectioning commands so that the
appendices are numbered differently. Thus each appendix should begin with an
appropriate sectioning command. In an article document class a section heading is
labelled with a capital letter and in the report and book classes a chapter is labelled
with a capital letter preceded by ``Appendix''.

are going to use 8fPHN2A0S to do it then use templates 8fPIN2A0I8bO3BN0E1Bibliography, BibStyle, DataBase,
DocTypes and 8fPIN2A0I8bO1AN0E1OptFields from the 8fPIN2A0K8bONN0E1BIBTEX group of templates. 

Insert  version 8fPIN2A0I8bO1GN0E1TheBibliography of  template 8fPIN2A0I8bO1IN0E1Bibliography(DIY) at the position in your

``References'' in an article and ``Bibliography'' in a report or book. Enter into the place
holder called 8fPIN2A0I8bO1DN0E1widest label the longest label of a reference that will appear in the list. 

 To insert a bibliographical item, move the cursor to the other  place holder and click on
the second or third versions of the template. The difference between the two is how the 
reference is labelled. With  version 8fPIN2A0I8bOON0E1BibItem  an item is labelled with a 202C on the screen
and an integer in the output.  With  version  8fPIN2A0I8bO1FN0E1BibItem[label], the user enters the label
into the leftmost place holder  and this appears both on the screen and in the final
output. The text of the reference is typed into the place holder labelled ``reference''
with both versions. The remaining place holder is for the key to the reference. (This is
entered into the place holder of the 8fPIN2A0I8bOLN0E1Cite version from template 8fPIN2A0I8bO1FN0E1Ref(other doc) when
referring the reader to this reference at places in the document.)  If another
bibliography item is to be entered move the cursor is to a position just before or after a
bibliographical item and repeat the process.

 This template can be used to generate a table of contents, list of figures and a list of
tables. Insert versions 8fPIN2A0I8bO1GN0E1TableOfContents, 8fPIN2A0I8bO1EN0E1ListOfFigures and 8fPIN2A0I8bO1DN0E1ListOfTables at the
position in the document where the lists are required. 

Remember that more than one run of 8fPHN2A0T  is necessary to generate these lists. 
During the first run, the entries for the lists are written to  files with extensions 8fPIN2A0H8bOKN0E1toc,
8fPIN2A0H8bOKN0E1lof and 8fPIN2A0H8bOKN0E1lot respectively. These are then read in during  the following run and the
lists generated.

For each type of list there are three versions with which to enter information, namely,
8fPIN2A0I8bO1HN0E1AddLine8fPHN2A0ISe1cf69dI   !2NCEllipsis    1FCLatex2e#EllipsisHelpGVe1cf69dJ#!CC202GIC\ldots »with no.,  8fPIN2A0I8bOPN0E1AddLine8fPHN2A0» and 8fPIN2A0I8bONN0E1AddTo8fPHN2A0» . The first two of these are used to
enter a line of text to the list while the third is usually  used to enter formatting
commands but can also be used for entering text. 

The number to be inserted with the 8fPIN2A0I8bO1HN0E1AddLine8fPHN2A0»with no8fPHN2A09Oversion is not the page number
(this is automatically generated) but the number of the figure or table,  or  the number
of a section unit such as a chapter.  (Thus if an entry for the table of contents referring
to chapter 2  is not to be entered automatically  but is to be entered instead using this
version, then the number would be two.) The version for the  list of figures and that for
the list of tables have one other place holder into which the line of text is entered.  The
table of contents' version has, in addition to a place holder for the text,  one in which the
type of the section heading must be entered. (In our example this would be chapter.)
Either enter this directly from the keyboard or use template 8fPIN2A0I8bO1MN0E1ContentsList-SecTypes 
(8fPIN2A0O8bOKN0E1not template 8fPIN2A0I8bO1GN0E1SectioningTypes).

The 8fPIN2A0I8bOPN0E1AddLine8fPHN2A0» versions are used in the same way as the 8fPIN2A0I8bO1HN0E1AddLine8fPHN2A0»with no8fPHN2A09Oversions
except there are no place holders in which to enter the numbers of figures, tables  or
section units.

The three  versions, 8fPIN2A0I8bOPN0E1AddToTOC, 8fPIN2A0I8bOPN0E1AddToLOF and 8fPIN2A0I8bOPN0E1AddToLOT,  can  be used  to  enter
formatting commands to the 8fPIN2A0H8bOKN0E1toc, 8fPIN2A0H8bOKN0E1lof and 8fPIN2A0H8bOKN0E1lot files. No page numbers are
generated with these versions.

Some 8fPHN2A0V commands may not be inserted directly into the text parameter of the
versions described above but must be protected. To do this either insert 8fPIN2A0r8bOIN0E1\8fPIN2A0H8bOON0E1protect or
template 8fPIN2A0I8bOON0E1Protect before the command in question. Failure do so may cause the error
message  8fPIN2A0H8bO2LN0E1! TEX capacity exceeded, sorry [...] to occur.

The final version 8fPIN2A0I8bO1DN0E1Enter number can be used with 8fPIN2A0I8bOPN0E1AddLine8fPHN2A0» versions in which  the
line should start with a number such as a table number. The version uses the  8fPHN2A0V
8fPIN2A0r8bOIN0E1\8fPIN2A0H8bO1BN0E1numberline command to do this. It is not necessary  to protect this command  with
template 8fPIN2A0I8bOON0E1Protect as this is included within  the definition of the  version itself.
Normally it is not necessary to use  this version--- just use an  8fPIN2A0I8bO1HN0E1AddLine8fPHN2A0»with
no8fPHN2A09Oversion instead.

To enter a line into the table of contents for the section 2 of chapter 3 of a document 
whose heading is ``British Trees'' we could use  version 8fPIN2A0I8bO1JN0E1AddLineTOCwith no8fPHN2A09Oto do
this. Into the ``sec-type'' place holder we would enter ``section'', into the ``sec. no.''
place holder we would enter ``3.2'' and into the ``text'' place holder ``British Trees''.

Alternatively we could have used version 8fPIN2A0I8bO1BN0E1AddLineTOC to do it. Again we would insert
``section'' into the ``sec-type'' place holder. This time however we must enter the
number and the heading British Trees into the ``text'' place holder. Use version 8fPIN2A0I8bO1DN0E1Enter
number to enter the number. (It is not necessary to protect the  command as this is
done within the  version definition.)

The index in the 8fPHN2A04 manual was produced with the aid of 8fPHN2A0R. To enter
an entry for this into the table of contents we first entered version 8fPIN2A0I8bO1GN0E1ClearDoublePage
from template 8fPIN2A0I8bO1AN0E1PageBreak in order to advance to the page where the index was to
begin. We then entered a line into the table of contents with version 8fPIN2A0I8bO1BN0E1AddLineTOC,
entering ``chapter'' into the ``sec type'' place holder and ``Index'' into the ``text'' place
holder. These instructions were followed immediately by the command to insert the
index at  the current position.

If you know an easier way of doing this please let me know.

Finally to insert 2em of extra vertical space between two entries in the table of contents 
we could use  version 8fPIN2A0I8bOPN0E1AddToTOC as follows:

8fPIN2A0O8bO1KN0E1Add to contents TOC - 8fPHN2A0t8fPIN2A0O8bOON0E1protect VSpace 8fPHN2A0t2 em8fPHN2A0s8fPHN2A0s

8fPIN2A0I8bO1DN0E1ContentsList which are used to enter a line into the table of contents.

 An ellipsis is a sequence of three dots used to indicate omitted text.  Enter the template
at the appropriate point in the text.  Note that this template should not be used in
mathematical formulae.

 The three versions of this template can be used to fill out a line of output with either
dots, white space or a continuous line. Unfortunately it is not possible to simulate this 
on the screen. Instead a fixed length is filled with either dots, space  or a line and
followed by a ``219N'' symbol.

 This template has two versions. The first is used to enter or amend the footnote. The
second can be used to hide its contents to improve the readability of the screen version.
Its presence is then only indicated by a bold italic superscript 8fPIN2A0G8bOIN0E1f. The output generated
by the two versions is identical.

 Usually 8fPHN2A0V inserts extra space after punctuation, for example, after a period
marking the end of a sentence. If version 8fPIN2A0I8bO1FN0E1French spacing is inserted into the
document  then, from then on, no extra space will be added after punctuation. To
revert to the usual spacing insert version 8fPIN2A0I8bO1JN0E1Not French spacing at the appropriate
place in the document. 

8fPIN2A0!8bO1EN0E1HyphenateHelp8fPJN2A0?8bO1AN0E1Hyphenate8bNIN0E28fPHN2A0D
 Usually 8fPHN2A0V breaks text into lines so that it is aligned at both the left and right
margins. This occasionally results in a word being split between two lines. Part of the
word and a hyphen are placed at the end of one line and the rest of the word at the
start of the following line. 8fPHN2A0V has been given rules on how to hyphenate a word
and usually does it correctly. If it does make a mistake this can be rectified with 
template 8fPIN2A0I8bO1AN0E1Hyphenate.

There are two possibilities. Either a global hyphenation instruction can be inserted into
the preamble or a specific instruction can be given for each occurrence of each
offending word.
8fPIN2A0\8bOJN0E18fPJN2A0[8bO22BN0E1This command should be placed in the preamble. Insert the 
word into the place holder with hyphens at each place at which it may be
hyphenated. More than one word can be inserted into the place holder. In that
case leave a space between words. Alternatively insert more than one instance
of this version of the template into the preamble. Note that the hyphenation
instruction will only be used to hyphenate that particular word.  It will not be
used as a guide to the hyphenation of similar words.

E.g.,8fPHN2A0µ8fPIN2A0O8bO1AN0E1Hyphenate in-ac-cu-ra-cy   in-ac-cu-rate8bN1FN0E2global command8fPJN2A0[8bO14JN0E1This command is used to tell 8fPHN2A0V where it may hyphenate a specific
word in the text. Insert into the word at the place or places at which it may be
hyphenated an instance of this version of the template. A centred dot will
appear at each place on the screen. (These do not appear in the final output.)

 The first version of this template, 8fPIN2A0I8bONN0E1Indent can be inserted at the start of a paragraph
where for some reason  no indentation has been   placed   but at which it is  required.
Similarly version 8fPIN2A0I8bOPN0E1NoIndent is placed at the start of a paragraph where no paragraph
indentation is  required but indentation does appear in the output.

--- 8fPHN2A0V, 8fPHN2A0U, 8fPHN2A0T, 8fPHN2A0S and 8fPHN2A0R.

 This template can be used to position text either centrally, flushleft or flushright on the
page depending on which of the three versions is selected. Use version 8fPHN2A08O of  template
8fPIN2A0I8bO1AN0E1LineBreak to indicate  to 8fPHN2A0V where it should split the text into lines.  8fPIN2A0Q8bO5KN0E1The text on

 8fPHN2A0V makes use of several length variables,  when producing the output. For
example one variable contains the desired width of text on the page. Several others
appear as versions in template 8fPIN2A0I8bO1BN0E1Parameters. The user may define his or her own
length variables with version 8fPIN2A0I8bO1BN0E1New Length of this template. Insert into the place holder
a name for the new variable. This must begin with a backslash (8fPHN2A0u) and naturally  may
not be the name of an existing variable. If you accidently give it the name of an existing
variable 8fPHN2A0V will output an error message.

A value can be assigned to a length variable with the 8fPIN2A0I8bO1BN0E1Set Length version. Insert into
the first place holder the name of the length variable and into the second its value. If
this is an absolute length don't forget the units. These may be 8fPIN2A0I8bOJN0E1cm, 8fPIN2A0I8bOJN0E1mm, 8fPIN2A0I8bOJN0E1in, 8fPIN2A0I8bOJN0E1em, 8fPIN2A0I8bOJN0E1ex,
8fPIN2A0I8bOJN0E1pc or 8fPIN2A0I8bOJN0E1pt.

The third version 8fPIN2A0I8bO1EN0E1Add to length enables the user to add a value to its existing value. As
before insert into the first place holder the name of the length variable. The change in
value is entered into the second place holder.

The 8fPIN2A0I8bO1KN0E1Set length to width will set the value of the variable whose name is entered into
the first place holder equal to the width necessary to typeset the contents of the second
place holder. For example if the text in the second place holder would occupy 2 cm of
space when processed by 8fPHN2A0V then the variable would be assigned a value of 2 cm.

The 8fPIN2A0I8bO1LN0E1Set length to height and 8fPIN2A0I8bO1KN0E1Set length to depth are similar. In the first case the
variable is set to the height the text in the second place holder reaches above the
baseline. In the second case, the distance that the text descends below the base line is
given.

 The user can insert  version 8fPIN2A0I8bO1BN0E1Line break from this template   into the text  forcing 
8fPHN2A0V to break the text at the points at which it is placed. Another version of 
template 8fPIN2A0I8bO1AN0E1LineBreak has a place holder with can take  the value  0, 1, 2, 3 or 4. The
value   given indicates how strongly you wish the text to be broken at the point in
question. 8fPIN2A0I8bO1EN0E1Line break[4] forces a break whereas 8fPIN2A0I8bO1EN0E1Line break[0] indicates no particular
wish for a break. The only difference that  the presence 8fPIN2A0I8bO1EN0E1Line break[0] makes is that a
break can be made at the point even if it is not allowed in normal circumstances, for
example in an already hyphenated word. 

The commands 8fPIN2A0I8bO1EN0E1No line break and 8fPIN2A0I8bO1HN0E1No line break[8fPIN2A0K8bOIN0E1T] are similar.  Versions
8fPIN2A0I8bO1EN0E1No line break and 8fPIN2A0I8bO1HN0E1No line break[4] prohibit a line break at the places at which they
are placed and 8fPIN2A0I8bO1HN0E1No line break[0] is the same as 8fPIN2A0I8bO1EN0E1Line break[0].

Line breaks can also be made with the commands 8fPHN2A08O and 8fPIN2A0I8bOON0E1NewLine. These two
commands, unlike the 8fPIN2A0I8bO1BN0E1Line break and 8fPIN2A0I8bO1EN0E1Line break[8fPIN2A0K8bOIN0E1T], do not force the line to be
padded out with space so that it ends flush at the right-hand margin. Version 
8fPIN2A08M8bOPN0E1[length] has a place holder for a length. This will cause vertical space of that length
to be inserted in the output after the line break.

Versions 8fPIN2A08M8bOIN0E1* and 8fPIN2A08M8bOON0E1*length are similar to versions 8fPHN2A08O and 8fPIN2A08M8bOPN0E1[length] except a page

The final two versions,  8fPIN2A08M8bONN0E1(hide) and 8fPIN2A08M8bO1FN0E1[length](hide) produce the same output as
versions  8fPHN2A08O and 8fPIN2A08M8bOPN0E1[length]. They produce, however, only white space on the screen.
These are for intended to be used only when the appearance of  the screen version is
important. For example when writing an on-line help file.

[The 8fPHN2A0V generated by some of these versions includes a call to 8fPIN2A0r8bOIN0E1\8fPIN2A0H8bOMN0E1empty. This
command does nothing but prevents an error occurring should the text following the
template begin with an opening square bracket ( [ ).  The simple solution of entering
matching curly brackets ( 8fPHN2A0t8fPHN2A0s ) causes  problems in a tabbing environment.]

 This template can be used to place a note in the margin of the document. There are 4
versions available. Use an ``enter'' version in order to enter the text of the note and
then if desired change the version to the corresponding ``hide'' one in order to improve
the appearance of the document on the screen.

With two-sided printing a marginal note is placed by default in the right-hand
margin on odd numbered pages and in the left margin on even numbered pages. For
one-sided printing a marginal note is placed in the right-hand margin. If you wish to
override these defaults and use the other margin then insert version 
8fPIN2A0I8bO1HN0E1notdefaultmargin into your document. To revert to the default convention again insert
version 8fPIN2A0I8bO1EN0E1defaultmargin into your document.

With two-column printing the nearest page margin is always used. (You can not
override this default.)

If you wish the marginal note to be different depending on whether it's placed in a left
or right margin then use a version with  ``8fPIN2A0I8bO2NN0E1different for left or right hand pages'' in its
name. Note that the text is positioned flush left in the margin. Thus if you wish the note
to be close to the text on a left hand page you should enter space at the start of the place
holder labelled ``note  if LHS page''. This can be done with version 8fPIN2A0I8bO1LN0E1fill out with space* 
of template 8fPIN2A0I8bO1BN0E1Horizontal (group 8fPIN2A0K8bOON0E1Spacing) as shown in the example.

make the height of text on each page the same.  To do this it may spread out the
text on the page by, for example, inserting extra vertical space between
paragraphs or around equations. 

This is the default when the 8fPIN2A0I8bOON0E1TwoSide class option has either (i) been selected 
or (ii) is the default for the document (8fPHN2A0j a book) and the 8fPIN2A0I8bOON0E1OneSide class

 Sometimes 8fPHN2A0V can not find a good place at which to split the text into pages. This
usually results in an insufficiently full page and an 8fPIN2A0H8bO1AN0E1Underfull 8fPIN2A0r8bOIN0E1\8fPIN2A0H8bOLN0E1vbox warning
message  being output.   You can insert the command  8fPIN2A0I8bO1CN0E1NoPageBreak  to (try) to
prohibit a page break or 8fPIN2A0I8bO1AN0E1PageBreak to cause a page break.  There are also versions of
these two commands with a place holder. This  can take  the value  0, 1, 2, 3 or 4. The
value   given indicates how strongly you  wish the page to (or not to) be broken at the
point in question.  8fPIN2A0I8bO1DN0E1PageBreak[4] is the same as 8fPIN2A0I8bO1AN0E1PageBreak and forces a break
whereas  8fPIN2A0I8bO1DN0E1PageBreak[0] indicates no particular wish for a break. 

If the 8fPIN2A0I8bO1AN0E1PageBreak or 8fPIN2A0I8bO1CN0E1NoPageBreak are positioned between two paragraphs then they
apply to that point. Otherwise they apply to the end of the  line in the 8fPHN2A0V output in
which they are placed.

You can also increase the height of text allowed on a page in order to put more text
than is normal on the page. To do this, insert the  command 8fPIN2A0I8bOON0E1Enlarge  above the point
where 8fPHN2A0V starts a new page. Set the place holder to a suitable length and then
insert command 8fPIN2A0I8bOON0E1NewPage at the point where you want a page break. The version
8fPIN2A0I8bO1JN0E1Enlarge 8fPHN2A0y Compress is similar excepts it also tries reduce the  amount of vertical
space on the page (8fPHN2A0l around equations) wherever possible. 

You can also cause a page break by inserting the command 8fPIN2A0I8bOON0E1NewPage at the desired
place. Unlike the 8fPIN2A0I8bO1AN0E1PageBreak command the 8fPIN2A0I8bOON0E1NewPage command will not cause the 
text on the page to be spaced out to reach the bottom of the page.

The 8fPIN2A0I8bO1AN0E1ClearPage version is similar to version 8fPIN2A0I8bOON0E1NewPage but in addition to starting a
new page it will cause any figures or tables which have not been output to be output
immediately on one or more pages containing no text.

The 8fPIN2A0I8bO1GN0E1ClearDoublePage version is similar to the 8fPIN2A0I8bO1AN0E1ClearPage version. If the 8fPIN2A0I8bOON0E1TwoSide
class option is either a default of the document class or has been selected, then this
version will also ensure that the next page of text is a right hand page by, if necessary, 
outputting a blank page.

The final two versions 8fPIN2A0I8bO1BN0E1One column and 8fPIN2A0I8bO1BN0E1Two column will execute a 8fPIN2A0I8bO1AN0E1ClearPage
command and then proceed typesetting with one or two columns of text per page
respectively.

If the 8fPIN2A0I8bO1AN0E1TwoColumn class option has been selected the 8fPIN2A0I8bO1AN0E1PageBreak and 8fPIN2A0I8bOON0E1NewPage 
commands will start a new column not a new page.

Inserting more than one 8fPIN2A0I8bOON0E1NewPage or 8fPIN2A0I8bO1AN0E1ClearPage version at the same place in the
document will not produce blank pages. The extra commands will be ignored.

 Some of the versions of some templates include a place holder for a label. These enable
the user to refer to a particular item without knowing how it will be numbered in the
8fPHN2A0V output. An example of such a template is template 8fPIN2A0I8bO1FN0E1SectionHeading which
includes versions with and without a place holder for a label. Suppose that a chapter
heading was inserted into a document with a version with a place holder for a label
and suppose that the label entered was  ``8fPIN2A0I8bO1AN0E1The input''. Then to refer to this chapter at
other places in the document  select either version 8fPIN2A0I8bOMN0E1(Ref) or 8fPIN2A0I8bOKN0E1Ref and insert 8fPIN2A0I8bO1AN0E1The input
into its place holder. Note that these versions only print the number of the sectioning
unit and any text such as chapter must be inserted  by the user. 

 A particular place in the book can be referenced by inserting a label  with the 8fPIN2A0I8bOMN0E1Label 
version at the required point. If it has been placed in a numbered environment, such as
an equation, then the number of that environment will by output by a  8fPIN2A0I8bOMN0E1(Ref) or 8fPIN2A0I8bOKN0E1Ref
command. Otherwise it is the number of the sectioning unit it is in. As many templates
have a version with a place holder for a label you are more likely to use version 8fPIN2A0I8bOMN0E1Label
in combination with versions 8fPIN2A0I8bO1AN0E1(PageRef)  or 8fPIN2A0I8bOON0E1PageRef. They  output the number of the
page in which  version 8fPIN2A0I8bOMN0E1Label has been inserted.  Note that these two versions do 8fPIN2A0O8bOKN0E1not
output the words ``page'' or ``pages''.

script place holders in the usual way. Unlike the 8fPIN2A0I8bOON0E1Scripts template there is no place
holder for the text that is to be scripted.

 These two templates can be used to insert a sectioning command into a document.

First enter a version of template 8fPIN2A0I8bO1FN0E1SectionHeading at the required position in the
document. There are eleven versions from which to choose. Use one of the first six (not
a ``hide'' version) to enter the sectioning heading. Each of these six versions has a place
holder for the type of sectioning command and a place holder for the text of the
heading.  The principal place holder is the text of the heading.  (Thus if the target is set
to some non-empty text when  the 8fPIN2A0I8bO1FN0E1SectionHeading template is selected the
``heading'' place holder will be filled by the target text.)  Insert the type of sectioning
command by clicking on a version from template 8fPIN2A0I8bO1GN0E1SectioningTypes.  

Every sectioning type is assigned a level number whereby the lower the value the more
important it is.  The heading of a sectioning command is entered into a table of contents
provided the level number of the sectioning command is less than or equal to the value
of parameter 8fPIN2A0O8bOPN0E1tocdepth. (See also the help for template 8fPIN2A0I8bO1BN0E1Parameters.  ``8fPIN2A0O8bOKN0E1toc'' is an
abbreviation for ``table of contents''.) The heading  may also be used in the running
head at the top of the page. If the heading is not suitable for these purposes   choose a
version  of 8fPIN2A0I8bO1FN0E1SectionHeading with 8fPIN2A0I8bOMN0E1[toc] in its name and insert the required entry for
the  table of contents and possibly the running head into the place holder provided.  For
example, if your section heading is very long then enter an abbreviated form of the
heading into the ``toc'' place holder. 

If the level number of the sectioning command is less than or equal to the value of 
variable 8fPIN2A0I8bO1CN0E1secnumdepth it will be automatically numbered unless a version of 
8fPIN2A0I8bO1FN0E1SectionHeading with 8fPIN2A0I8bOPN0E1[no no.] is chosen. In this case not only will the section not be
numbered but no entry for it will be written into a table of contents. If you don't wish it
to be numbered but do wish it to be entered into the table of contents chose a version
with 8fPIN2A0I8bOPN0E1[no no.] and then use a version from template 8fPIN2A0I8bO1EN0E1Contents-List to enter the entry
into the table of contents.

In order to be able to refer to the section choose a version with 8fPIN2A0I8bOMN0E1label in its name and
insert a label into the place holder.  The section can be referenced by entering either
version 8fPIN2A0I8bOKN0E1ref or 8fPIN2A0I8bOMN0E1(ref) from template 8fPIN2A0I8bO1GN0E1Ref(within doc) into the document with the  label 
inserted into its place holder.

The other five versions of this template are ``hide'' versions for five of the first six
versions. The screen version of each of the five ``hide'' versions is the same as that of
the first  version. That is, only the sectioning type and the heading are shown.  These
five versions are used to improve the appearance of the document on the screen. The
8fPHN2A0V output is  unchanged.

  The easiest way to overcome line break problems is to instruct 8fPHN2A0U to be ``sloppy''
about where they occur.  To specify the scope of ``sloppy'' line breaks just set the target
to the text that is to be set in a ``sloppy'' fashion and click on the template.

Some 8fPHN2A0V commands can take an optional argument. Such arguments are
delimited by square brackets ( [  and  ] ). Occasionally a square bracket occurring in
the document is mistaken for the opening or closing square bracket around an optional
argument.  In such circumstances replace the brackets entered from the keyboard
by versions of this template.

An example of this problem occurred when I entered  8fPIN2A0I8bO1PN0E1PageBreak[ 0,1,2,3 or 4] into the
``label'' place holder of the 8fPIN2A0I8bOLN0E1Item version of  template 8fPIN2A0I8bO1CN0E1Description when I was listing the
versions of the  8fPIN2A0I8bO1AN0E1PageBreak template in its associated help file. The contents of the ``label''

 The four versions of this template output a vertical line with no width. Thus it can not
be seen in the output. It can be used, for example, to increase the vertical space around
some text or expression, or the space between two lines of output.

into a place holder  are separated from each other  by a newline character. That is,
enter either 8fPHN2A0u8fPHN2A0u directly from the keyboard  or insert 8fPIN2A0I8bOON0E1newline or 8fPHN2A08O from template

  This template is used to prevent 8fPHN2A0V starting a new line in the middle of
something which should not be split. Insert the item which mustn't be split into the

For example, suppose a two word name is split by a line break between the two words.
Replacing this space with the 8fPHN2A0x symbol may have the desired effect but it may cause
one of the two words to be hyphenated and a line break inserted after the hyphen.  A
solution is two insert the two words into the place holder of this template.

  This template generates either the 8fPHN2A0V commands 8fPIN2A0r8bOMN0E1\verb and 8fPIN2A0r8bONN0E1\verb* or  the
verbatim and verbatim*  environments in the 8fPHN2A0V code output by 8fPHN2A04.
8fPHN2A0V will output the contents of the argument of  8fPIN2A0r8bOMN0E1\verb commands and the
contents of verbatim environments in a typewriter font  exactly as they have been
entered. Thus the 10 special 8fPHN2A0V characters require no special treatment here and
can be entered directly from the keyboard. 

 The four versions of this template with names starting with ``8fPIN2A0I8bOMN0E1Short'' generate the
8fPIN2A0r8bOMN0E1\verb command and only  texts not including a new line may be entered into their
place holders.  The 8fPIN2A0r8bOMN0E1\verb command uses a character to delimit its argument and
thus this character may not appear in the argument itself. Versions have been made
which use the ``+'' and ``?'' characters as delimiters. If both of these characters appear
in your text make another version of this template using a different character. (This
may 8fPIN2A0Q8bOKN0E1not be a letter, a space or a *.)

The ``Long'' version generates the verbatim environment and the same line breaks
will occur in the output as appear on the screen.

These versions must be used with care since the output corresponds exactly to the
contents of the argument or environment in the 8fPIN2A0H8bOKN0E1tex file and not to that in the place
holder in the 8fPIN2A0H8bOKN0E1mpd file. For example, suppose a symbol has been entered into the place
holder from the symbol table.  Then the 8fPHN2A0V command corresponding to the
symbol will appear in the output and not the symbol itself.

Finally there are versions which output 8fPIN2A0¿8fOIN0A1229E for each space.

Note that 8fPIN2A0r8bOMN0E1\verb and 8fPIN2A0r8bONN0E1\verb* commands may not appear in the argument of
another 8fPHN2A0V command.
